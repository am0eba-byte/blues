Well they call me hurricane an' I've come to play in your
town

Yeah, they call hurricane an' I've come to play in your town

If you don't like my music I'm sure gonna drive to your town



Yeah, I like my pocket full of money, my whiskey, gin and wine

Yes I like my pocket full of money, my whiskey, gin and wine

Y'all can come to dinner, love my lovin' all the time



Yeah, they call me hurricane an' I've come to play in your town

Yeah, they call me hurricane an' I've come to play in your town

If I can't play this guitar I'm sure gonna drive to your town
