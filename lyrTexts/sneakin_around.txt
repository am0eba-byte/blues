Well hello, pretty baby,

I just called to say that we're thru

Because I'm so tired of sneaking around with you

I wanna meet you in the sunlight,

not in a secret rendevouz

Because I'm so tired of sneaking around with you



Oh, you never, you never be meant to be mine,

oh, I was just too blind to see

Oh, but I got my pride, so why should we hide,

when you light this, we'll be free

Oh I love you, you know I love you,

oh, and I wanna tell the world, I do,

that's why I'm so tired of sneaking around with you

Oh, I'm so tired of sneaking around with you

Oh, I'm so tired of sneaking around with you
