<lyrics>



Well I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you

Yeah I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you



Well I'm dreamin' all the sweet dreams and the memories of the
past

Feel so fine honey, that's why our love should last

Feel so good baby and it's all because of you

I've gotta love ya, I need to love ya, I want to love ya so nice

We're havin' all the time to ourselves

Yeah, we're havin' all the fun to ourselves



Lord I'm pickin' up the pieces off the shelf

Won't take long baby 'cause there's hardly any left

Feel so good baby but it's all because of you



I've gotta love ya, I need to love ya, I want to love ya so nice

I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you

Yeah I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you



Well I'm dreamin' all the sweet dreams and the memories of the
past

Feel so fine honey, that's why our love should last

Feel so good darlin' and it's all because of you

I've gotta love ya, I need to love ya, I want to love ya so nice



I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you

Yeah, I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you

Yeah, I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you</lyrics></xml>
