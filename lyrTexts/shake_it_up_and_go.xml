<lyrics>


<l>You might be old, about 90 years

</l>
<l>But you ain't too old to shift them gears

</l>
<l>You can shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

</l>
<l>Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

</l>
<l>You good-looking people sure can shake it up and go



</l>
<l>Mama killed a chicken, she thought it was a duck

</l>
<l>She put it on the table with his legs sticking up

</l>
<l>She had to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

</l>
<l>Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

</l>
<l>You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go



</l>
<l>I told my baby the week before last

</l>
<l>The gait she had was just a little too fast

</l>
<l>She had to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

</l>
<l>Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

</l>
<l>You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go



</l>
<l>Look here baby, you ain't treating me right

</l>
<l>You go out everyday, stay out late at night

</l>
<l>You got to shake it up and go, baby (Shake it up and go)

</l>
<l>You got to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

</l>
<l>You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go</l></lyrics></xml>
