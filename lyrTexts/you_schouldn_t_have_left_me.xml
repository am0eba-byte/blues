<lyrics>



You shouldn't have left me, baby

Baby, you shouldn't have gone away

Oh, you shouldn't have left me, baby

Baby, you shouldn't have gone away

Oh, you left the one that love you, woman

Cryin' every night and every day



Someone that you love more, baby

Made you break my heart in two

Someone that you love more, baby

Made you break my heart in two

I want you to remember, baby

The same thing could happen to you



When the pains in your heart, woman

Make you feel like you could die

Oh, when the pains, the pains in your heart, baby

Make you feel like you could die

Oh, you'll know then that you shouldn't have left me, woman

Baby, and how it feels to say goodbye</lyrics></xml>
