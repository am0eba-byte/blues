<lyrics>



All day long I'm worried, all night long I'm blue

I'm so awfully lonesome, I don't know what to do

So I ask you doctor, see if you can't find

Something in your satchel to satisfy my mind

Doctor, doctor, write me a prescription for the blues

The wearied blues



Let me tell you doctor, why I'm in misery

Once I had a lover, he went away from me

Sent to see the gypsy, 
voodoo

doctors too

Shook their heads and told me, nothing they could do

Doctor, doctor, write me a prescription for the blues

The mean old blues



Like a little baby, all day long I cry

And if you can't cure me, I just am sure to die

Give me something, poison, doctor won't you please

Then I'll sign a paper: died with the heart's disease

Doctor, doctor, write me a prescription for the blues

The plain old blues</lyrics></xml>
