<lyrics>



When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name

When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name

Oh, I was feelin' low on the ground, bad luck and evil women were to
blame



I never realized how sweet and kind one woman can be

I never realized, people, how sweet and kind a woman can be

Oh, but when I looked in your eyes, I knew true love had come to
me

Yeah



Take my hand, hold it tight and don't let go

Take my hand, take my hand, hold it tight and don't let go

'Cause our love is like a merry-go-round, forever and ever round it
goes</lyrics></xml>
