<lyrics>



Days into weeks

Weeks into months

Months into years I'm blue

I'm cracking up over you



I can't survive

I need you here by my side

Ever word I say is true

I'm cracking up over you



When I can see you again

Don't know just when that will be

But baby, just look

Can't you see what you're doin' to me?



Why do you, why do you torture me?

Never give me a smile

That brings tears from my eyes

I'm cracking up over you



My heart suffers, suffers pain

Nothin' seems to be the same

But with you baby, I'll suffer again

I'm cracking up over you</lyrics></xml>
