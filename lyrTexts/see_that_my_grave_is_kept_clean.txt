Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you

Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you

There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you

You can see that my grave is kept clean



And there's two white horses following me

And there's two white horses following me

I got two white horses following me

Waiting on my burying ground



Did you ever hear that coffin' sound

Have you ever heard that coffin' sound

Did you ever hear that coffin' sound

Means another poor boy is under ground



Did you ever hear them church bells tone

Have you ever hear'd them church bells tone

Did you ever hear them church bells tone

Means another poor boy is dead and gone



Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold

And, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold

Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold

Now I believe what the bible told



There's just one last favor I'll ask of you

And there's one last favor I'll ask of you

There's just one last favor I'll ask of you

See that my grave is kept clean

Lemon Jefferson's most famous folk song contains a wish that has been
fulfilled by some of his many admirers. A group of contemporary
artists came together to get him a new headstone. The grave is in the
segregated section of the Wortham, Texas, cemetery on Highway 14,
some 85 miles south of Dallas. So, if you're in the 'hood... This is
a 
picture
of his grave
