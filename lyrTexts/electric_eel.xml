<lyrics>


<l>The pages of my history

</l>
<l>Ain't no great big mystery

</l>
<l>For the price of petty bribes

</l>
<l>Separation of the tribes



</l>
<l>Men with guns have leadeth us

</l>
<l>Down their path of righteousness

</l>
<l>A thousand trips around the sun

</l>
<l>Hard to tell who lost and won

</l>
<l>Who lost?



</l>
<l>The faces in the mist I see

</l>
<l>Ain't no great big mystery

</l>
<l>Loss of heart, loss of mind

</l>
<l>Lost some chrome through tests of time

</l><l>Through tests of time</l></lyrics></xml>
