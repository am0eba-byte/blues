<lyrics>


<l>I'm picking up on a signal, that's in the air tonight

</l>
<l>It's sparkin' my receiver, it feels like dynamite

</l>
<l>I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you



</l>
<l>My mind is electric, I'm about to blow a fuse

</l>
<l>The cockpit is empty so shoot it down the tube

</l>
<l>I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you



</l>
<l>I've got to make a connection, I'm on needles and pins

</l>
<l>Workin' up a printout and I'm gonna zero in

</l>
<l>I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you</l></lyrics></xml>
