Oh you just my color, oh you just my kind

Oh you just my color, oh you just my kind

Lord, you keep me worried babe, oh, messed up in mind



Well, I got up last night, reachin' upside the wall

I got up last night (that he was), teachin' upside the wall

Lord, I love my baby, but I declare, ooo, she's the cause of it
all



Don't know what to do, 'bout the trouble I have

Don't know what to do, 'bout the trouble I have

I might try to find me some rest, babe, in the world, somewhere



Well, my baby done left me, she don't know how I've cried

Well, my baby done left me, she don't know how I've cried

Lord, she's a pretty little girl, oh she's tryin'a wreck my life
