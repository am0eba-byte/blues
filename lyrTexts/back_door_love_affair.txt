Got to have you baby, don't you say that you don't care

Got to have you baby, don't you say that you don't care

Any way you want it baby, I'll settle for a back door love affair



I call you on the telephone, the party says that you ain't there

I call you on the telephone, the party says that you ain't there

When a man asked who's callin', I said, "Just tell 'em it's a back
door love affair"
