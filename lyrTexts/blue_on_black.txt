Night, falls,

I'm alone

Skin, yeah,

chilled me to the bone

You, turned and you ran,

oh, slipped from the edge of my hand



Blue on black,

tears on a river

Push on a shove,

it don't mean much

Whisper on a scream,

doesn't change a thing

Don't bring you back

Blue on black



Blind, oh,

now I see

truth, lies,

and in between

Wrong,

can't be undone

Slipped,

from the tip of your tongue



Blue on black,

tears on a river

Push on a shove,

it don't mean much

Whisper on a scream,

doesn't change a thing

Don't bring you back

Blue on black
