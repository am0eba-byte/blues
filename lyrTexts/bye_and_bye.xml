Bye and bye, gone to see the king

Bye and bye, gone to see the king

Bye and bye, gone to see the king

Lord, I wouldn't mind dyin' down there



Lord, I hear, can't go by myself

Lord, I hear, can't go by myself

Lord, I hear, can't go by myself

Lord, I wouldn't mind dyin' down there



Hallelujah, glory to his name

Hallelujah, glory to his name

Hallelujah, glory to his name

Lord, I wouldn't mind dyin' down there</lyrics></xml>
