My baby she wrote me a letter

She didn't call me on the phone

Five little words was all she wrote

See ya later I'm gone



She had no explanation

About why she had to go

Well I can't take a joke,

But I can take a hint

She don't love me no more



(Chorus:)

But if nobody loves you

And you feel like dust

On an empty shelve

Just remember

You can love yourself



My mother says

She loves me

But you know

She could be 
jivin'

too

And everybody's always criticizing

Everything that I do



I work 9 to 5, do the best I can

Try to please the boss

I bought a big ol' house,

And a brand new car

And then he laid me off



(Chorus)



Everytime I meet a lady

I wanna try to get to know

Either I'm too small

Or she's too tall

She's rich and I'm po'

So I called my old friend

Hazel Mae

Asked her out for a little date

She said: I'm married now

And I got three little kids,

Boy ya just a little too late



(Chorus 2x)
