<lyrics>



I work hard everyday

Do the same at night

But still my baby

Ain't treating me right



Tell me baby baby baby baby

What can I do?

Do I have to shut your mouth

Just to get along with you?



When I'm home at night

I can't read a book

Without you being huffed up

Giving me a dirty look



Tell me baby baby baby baby

What can I do?

Do I have to shut your mouth

Just to get along with you?



She's so jealous, man

Till it's a sin

She don't even trust me

Out with men



Tell me baby baby baby baby

What can I do?

Do I have to shut your mouth

Just to get along with you?</lyrics></xml>
