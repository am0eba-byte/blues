Where do you go after midnight,

when all the doors should be closed

Your alibis just dont sound right,

I asked but nobody knows

Then you look me in the eyes,

and make it sound so very nice

With your true lies



Someones been sleepin in my bed,

this room dont smell like you and me

Someones been sneakin out the window,

do you think Im too blind too see

When you look me in the eyes,

and make it sound so very nice

With your true lies,

it was a clever disguise

But, girl Im gettin wise,

to your true lies



Well, you been doin this so long now,

youre thinkin its the truth

I guess it dont seem so wrong if it,

aint bein done to you

Gotta lot to learn, baby,

you cant keep it down

When the word gets in the wind,

then its bound to blow back around



Girl, can you give me a reason,

I bet you dont know even know why

Cause I cant figure out what youre
thinkin,

or what is your tiyn to justify

When you look me in the eyes,

and make it sound so very nice

With your true lies,

it was a clever disguise

But, girl Im gettin wise,

to your true lies

Yeah, you can laugh, you can cry,

but, girl, I just cant buy,

your true, true lies
