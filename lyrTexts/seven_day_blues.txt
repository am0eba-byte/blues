Every Monday mornin', people just a worry full day

Every Monday mornin', people just a worry full day

I think about my daddy, who's many miles away



Every Tuesday mornin', whiskey is all I crave

Every Tuesday mornin', whiskey is all I crave

The blues and booze are goin' to carry me to my grave



Wednesdays and Thursdays, I try to wear the blues away

Wednesdays and Thursdays, I try to wear the blues away

But when you get 'em about your daddy, they really come to stay



Every Friday people, is always my bad luck day

Every Friday people, is always my bad luck day

That's the day my man packed up and went away



I woke up Saturday mornin', tryin' to find my man

I woke up Saturday mornin', tryin' to find my man

I ain't got nobody to lend me a helpin' hand
