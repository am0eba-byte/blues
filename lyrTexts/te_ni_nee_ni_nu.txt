I want you, to be my ti ni nee ni nu

I want you, to be my ti ni nee ni nu

Tell me the truth, ain't you my ti ni nee ni nu



Now will you love, will you love me

Will you squeeze me, come on don't tease me

Tell me the truth, ain't you me ti ni nee ni nu



Come on baby, work your show, walk the dog boog-a-loo, you got the
floor

Everybodys watchin' you, you lookin' good baby, ain't that the
truth

Now when you're through, come be my ti ni nee ni nu



_________

Note 1: ti ni nee ni nu, as far as I know this is just a non-sense
word creation. It probably has the meaning of "baby", "darling",
etc..
