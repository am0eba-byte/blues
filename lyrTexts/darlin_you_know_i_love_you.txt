Darlin', darlin' you know I love you,

I love you, for myself

But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else



I think of you, think of you every morning

I dream of you, every night, and with love,

love to be with you always



When night began to fall,

I cry, cry alone

And I wish, maybe I can hold you in my arms tonight



Oh, darlin', darlin' you know I love you,

I love you, for myself

But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else
