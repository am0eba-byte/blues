If you love me like you say

Why you treat me like you do?

If you love me like you say, baby

Why you treat me like you do?

Well I ain't no fool

I'm cool, I know the rule



Said ya'd never run around

Said ya'd never stay out late

Said ya'd never run around, baby

Said ya'd never stay out late

Let me tell ya pretty baby

I've got to set ya straight



If you love me like ya say

Why you treat me like ya do?

If you love me like ya say, baby

Why you treat me like ya do?

Well I ain't no fool

I'm cool, I know the rule



Hey!



Said ya'd never run around

Said ya'd never stay out late

Said ya'd never run around, baby

Said ya'd never stay out late

Let me tell ya pretty baby

I've got to set ya straight



Why-yi-yi-yi

Oh let ya, set ya straight

Why-yi-yi-yi

I'm cool, I know the rule
