<lyrics>



Oh, I got a feelin', blues gonna be my only way

Oh, I got a feelin', blues gonna be my only way

'Cause when you're lookin' for somebody, lookin' for somebody



Tell me woman, how do you see a man like me?

Tell me woman, how do you see a man like me?

You look so nice, you feel so warm



Oh, I got a feelin', blues gonna be my only way

'Cause I got a feelin', people, blues gonna be my only way

'Cause when you're lookin' for somebody, lookin' for somebody</lyrics></xml>
