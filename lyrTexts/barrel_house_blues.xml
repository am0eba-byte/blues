Got the 
barrel
house
 blues, feeling awfully dry

Got the barrel house blues, feeling awfully dry

I can't drink 
moonshine

'cause I'm afraid I'd die



Papa likes his sherry, mama likes her port

Papa likes his sherry, mama likes her port

Papa likes to shimmy, mama likes to sport



Papa likes his bourbon, mama likes her gin

Papa likes his bourbon, mama likes her gin

Papa likes his outside women

men
