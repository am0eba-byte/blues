<lyrics>



When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

My eyes was full of tears since she left me behind



I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet

I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet

My eyes are full of tears, where can my baby be?



I went to see a gypsy to get my fortune read

I went to see a gypsy to have my fortune read

My head hung in sorrow when she said what she said



When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind</lyrics></xml>
