All the love I miss loving, all the kiss I miss kissing

All the love I miss loving, all the kiss I miss kissing

Before I met you baby, never knew what I was missing



All your love, pretty baby, that I got in store for you

All your love, pretty baby, that I got in store for you

I love you pretty baby, well I say you love me too



All your loving, pretty baby, all your loving, pretty baby

All your loving, pretty baby, all your loving, pretty baby

Since I first met you baby, I never knew what I was missing



Hey, hey baby, hey, hey baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, oh, oh, baby

Since I first met you baby, never knew what I was missing
