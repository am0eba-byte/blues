<lyrics>



Oh well, this here's my last affair

Oh well, this here's my last affair

I'm gon' grab my clothes, baby, daddy's gonna leave you there



Ooo yeah, you can write to me sometime

Ooo yeah darlin', you can write to me sometime

If you write to me, darlin', I'll let ya know, I feel fine



Too late to worry, too late to worry when I'm gone

Too late to worry, darlin', too late to worry when I'm gone

I'm leavin' you early in the mo'nin', because little girl, well, you
have done me wrong</lyrics></xml>
