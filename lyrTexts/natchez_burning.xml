<lyrics>



Did you ever hear about the burning,

that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town

Did you ever hear about the burning,

that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town



Those buildings got to burning, there's my baby layin'on the
ground

Charlotte Jones was there, Luiza was there,

Rosie Mae was there, Louise was there



Did you ever hear about the burning,

that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town

I stood back, was lookin', and the old building come tumble down</lyrics></xml>
