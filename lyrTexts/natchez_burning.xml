<lyrics>


<l>Did you ever hear about the burning,

</l>
<l>that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town

</l>
<l>Did you ever hear about the burning,

</l>
<l>that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town



</l>
<l>Those buildings got to burning, there's my baby layin'on the
ground

</l>
<l>Charlotte Jones was there, Luiza was there,

</l>
<l>Rosie Mae was there, Louise was there



</l>
<l>Did you ever hear about the burning,

</l>
<l>that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town

</l>
<l>I stood back, was lookin', and the old building come tumble down</l></lyrics></xml>
