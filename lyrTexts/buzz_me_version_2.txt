When I saw you this morning, baby, tell me why did you walk away

When I saw you this morning, baby, tell me why did you walk away

I can't believe that you don't want me, I thought our love was here
to stay



Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

But if you forgot the number, come on over, you won't have to call at
all



I never lied to no one, I ain't gonna lie to you

When I say I'm yours forever, every word I say is true

Buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

But if you forgot the number, come on over, and you won't have to
call at all



Buzz me, buzz me, baby, you mean so awfully much to me

Buzz me, buzz me, baby, I'm just like a ship that's lost at sea

But when I get my arm around you, ain't gonna let go till 2003
