<lyrics>



Oh, I asked her for water, she brought me gasoline

Oh, I asked her for water, she brought me gasoline

That's the troublingest woo-hoo (
woman?
), that I ever seen



The church bell tollin', the hearse come driving slow

The church bell tollin', the hearse come driving slow

I hope my baby, don't leave me no more



Oh tell me baby, when are you coming back home?

Oh tell me baby, when are you coming back home?

You know I love you baby, but you've been gone too long</lyrics></xml>
