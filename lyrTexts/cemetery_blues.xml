<lyrics>



Folks, I know a gal named Cemetery Lize, down in Tennessee

She has got a pair of mean old graveyard eyes, full of misery

Every night and day, you can hear her sing a blues away



I'm going down to the cemetery 'cause the world is all wrong

I'm going down to the cemetery 'cause the world is all wrong

Down there with the spooks, to hear 'em sing my sorrow song



Got a date to see a ghost by the name of Jones

Got a date to see a ghost by the name of Jones

Makes me feel happy to hear him rattle his bones



He's one man I always know just where to find

He's one man I always know just where to find

When you want true lovin' go and get the cemetery kind



He ain't no fine dresser, he don't wear nothing but a sack

Yeah, he ain't no fine dresser, he don't wear nothing but a sack

Everytime he kisses me that funny feeling creeps up my back</lyrics></xml>
