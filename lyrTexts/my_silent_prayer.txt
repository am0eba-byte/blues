My silent prayer is the love we knew

If it should reach all of the heart of you

I'll offer the heart you had manage to break

I'll offer the love that forgave your mistake



Deep in my heart you still belong to me

I only know I'll never, never be free

Please don't consider the love a closed episode

The love that we knew comes to few

For my silent love is for you and only for you
