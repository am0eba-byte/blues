I read your ad this morning you, said you want a real good
man

I read your ad this morning you, said you want a real good man

Now I'm here with you baby, I want to know your plan



When I'll be goin' to work, I have to wear my uniform

When I'll be goin' to work, I have to wear my uniform

I got news for you baby, I keep the darn thing on



Well I can't 
hully
gully
, I can't do a 
shimmy
,

but when it comes to lovin', I'm a lovin' little fool

Come on daddy, love me all night long

I got news for you Johnny, win yourself a home



Well go to the bedroom, honey fix the bedroom up

Well go to the bedroom, Johnny fix the bedroom up

Got a whole lotta talkin', Johnny wanna talk to you, alright
