 Well I'm dyin' with the flu, oh, an' I don't know what to do
 Well
            I'm dyin' with the flu, oh, an' I don't know what to do
 Well my doctor gave
            me up, he said, "I can't do no more for you"

            
 Please call my girlfriend, tell her I'm goin' on home
 Yes, please
            call my girlfriend, tell her I'm goin' on home
 Yeah, you tell 'em that flu
            is chillin', an' I don't want her to weep an' moan
 Alright

            
 Well it's gettin' dark, ev'rything seem to fade out
 Well it's
            gettin' dark, ev'ything seem to be fadin' out
 Well I hate to leave this old
            world but I found out what dyin' is all about
