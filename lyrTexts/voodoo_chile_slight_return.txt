Well I'm standin' next to a mountain, Chopin' down with the
edge of my hand

Well I'm standin' next to a mountain, Chopin' down with the edge of
my hand

Pick up the pieces, make an island, might even raise a little
sand



'Cause I'm a 
voodoo

chile, Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile



I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time,

give it right back to you, one of these days

I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time,

give it right back to you, the rest of my days



I won't see you again in this world, see ya in the next one,

don't be late, don't be late



'Cause I'm a voodoo chile yeah, Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile
