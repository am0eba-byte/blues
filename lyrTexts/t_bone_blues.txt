I love my baby, she's so mean to me

Yes I love my baby, she's so mean to me

I'm gonna change my way of living baby, move across the deep blue
sea



You know you didn't want me baby, when you climbed up on my
knee

You were drinkin' 
moonshine

whiskey mama, tryin' to 
jive

poor me

Yes I love you, yes I love you, yes I love, and I don't care what you
do



Brownskin woman, who might you're good man be

Brownskin woman, who might you're good man be

Say the reason why I ask you baby, you sure look good to me
