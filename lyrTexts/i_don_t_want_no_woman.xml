<lyrics>


<l>I don't want nobody telling me what to do

</l>
<l>I don't want nobody telling me what to do

</l>
<l>Oh I'm gonna leave you darlin', 'cause I'm just as grown as you



</l>
<l>I don't want nobody telling me this and that

</l>
<l>I don't want nobody telling me this and that

</l>
<l>Oh I'm gonna leave you darling, 'cause I don't go for that



</l>
<l>You drink your whiskey, I'll drink my wine

</l>
<l>You tend to your business and I'll tend to mine



</l>
<l>I don't want nobody telling me how to live my life

</l>
<l>Oh I'm gonna leave you darling, just don't want to be your wife



</l>
<l>Well you used to boss your girl, that I won't deny

</l>
<l>Before I let you boss me I'm gonna lay down and die



</l>
<l>I don't want nobody telling me what to do

</l>
<l>I don't want nobody telling me what to do

</l><l>Oh I'm gonna leave you darlin', 'cause I'm just as grown as you</l></lyrics></xml>
