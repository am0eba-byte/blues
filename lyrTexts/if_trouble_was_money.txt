If trouble was money, I'd swear I'd be a millionaire

If trouble was money, babe, I'd swear I'd be a millionaire

For you I'd buy the whole world, woman, I'd buy the whole world and
have money to spare, yeah



Worry, worry, worry, worry, babe, I had worries on my mind, yeah

I said, worry, worry, worry, worry, woman, I had worries all my life,
yeah yeah

You know times is hard, baby, I swear, I won't tell you know lie



My mother used to tell me, she said, "Son, there gonna be days, gonna
be days like this"

My mother used to tell me, she said, "Son, there gonna be days, it's
gonna be days, be days like this"

She said, "I always want you to be a winner", she said, "Son, I don't
want you to quit"
