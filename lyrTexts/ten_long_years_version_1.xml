<lyrics>



Oh, I had a woman, she was nice and loving to me in every way

Oh, I had a woman, she was nice and loving to me in every way

Oh, she used to love me, bring my breakfast to the bed everyday



Oh, for ten long years, yes, she was my pride and joy

Oh, for ten long years, she was my pride and joy

Well, I used to call her my little girl and she used to call me her
little boy



Well, it's all over, baby, baby, you know I'm all alone

Well, it's all over, baby, baby, you know I'm all alone

Well, the reason I sing these blues, yes, you know my baby's gone</lyrics></xml>
