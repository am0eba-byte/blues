<lyrics>



You won't listen to nothing I tell you, baby, you keep on doing just
as you please

Hey, you won't do nothing I tell you, baby, keep on doing as you
please

I've taken as long as I can, baby, when is this foolishness gonna
cease



I've worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day

I said I've worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day

You don't believe me, baby, but I'm gonna leave one of these days



Well, you told me that you love me, but actions speak louder than
words

Oh, you said you love me, baby, but action speaks louder than
words

I won't be fooled no longer, baby, that line everybody's heard



Well, If you're gonna change, baby, you better do it real soon

Hey, If you're gonna change, for the better, baby, you better do it
real soon

Because you'll wake up one of these mornings, find yourself in a
empty room
