Now Maudie, baby, I love you

Aoh Maudie, baby, I love you

You've been gone so long, 'cause I miss you so



Now Maudie, why did you hurt me

Ooh Maudie, why did you hurt me

I love you baby, you've been gone so long



Now Maudie, baby, I love you

Aoh Maudie, baby, I love you

You've been gone so long, 'cause I miss you so</lyrics></xml>
