<lyrics>



One more day, one more day of being alone

One more day, one more day of being alone

Got a letter from my baby, sayin' she's on her way back home



Why don't you call me baby, sayin' you'll bring you're bringin' your
clothes back home

Why don't you call me baby, sayin' you'll bring you're bringin' your
clothes back home

You know I'm crazy about you baby, but you been gone away too
