You're a mean mistreater, mama, you don't mean me no good

You just a mean-mistreater mama, you don't mean me no good

I can't blame you, baby, I'd be the same way if I could



You know in the mo'nin', baby, when I come 'n, knocked on your
door

You had a nerve to tell me, that you don't want me no more



And then also baby, when I knocked upon your door

You had a nerve to tell me, don't want me no mo'



Didn't you say you was gonna leave me, did you say you was goin'
away?

Did you say you was gonna leave me, didn't you say you was goin'
away?

That's alright baby, you gonna come back home someday
