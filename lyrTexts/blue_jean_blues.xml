<l>I done ran into my baby and finally found my old blue jean

</l>
<l>Well, I could tell that they was mine from the oil and the

gasoline

<l>If I ever get back my blue jean, Lord, how happy could one man be

</l>

</l><l>'Cause if I get back those blue jean you know, my baby be bringin'</l>
<l>'em home to me</l></lyrics></xml>
