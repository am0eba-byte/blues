<lyrics>





Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm


You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down

Lookin' for yo' good friend, none can be found

You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


Nnn, the woman I love, took from my best friend

Some joker got lucky, stole her back again

She better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

(spoken: Mama, can't you hear that wind howl?

Oh how the wind do howl!)

You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


Nnn, the woman that I love, I crave to see

She's up the country, won't write to me

Then, you better come on in my kitchen, goin' to be rainin' outdoors


I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see

Some other man got my woman, lonesome blues got me

But she better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


My mamma dead, papa well's
1

to be, ain't got nobody to love and care for me

She better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
