<lyrics>


<l>Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in

</l>
<l>Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in

</l>
<l>Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I must've had too much weekend



</l>
<l>Call my job, have someone operate my machine

</l>
<l>Call my job, have someone operate my machine

</l>
<l>You look so good to me this morning, I must've had too much

weekend




</l>
<l>Hang the hat off the hook, lock the door too, spend my time, making
love to you

</l>
<l>Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in Friday, Saturday,
Sunday,

</l>
<l>I must've had too much weekend</l></lyrics></xml>
