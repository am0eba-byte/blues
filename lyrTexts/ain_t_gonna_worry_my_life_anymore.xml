<lyrics>



Don't care when you go, how long you stay

Good time treatments, bring you back someday

Oh but someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life any more



Ain't but one thing, give me the blues

When I've worn a hole, in my last pair of shoes

Oh but someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life any more</lyrics></xml>
