<l>I'm so disgusted and broken hearted, too

</l>
<l>I'm so disgusted and broken hearted, too

</l>
<l>Though I'm disappointed in your love, baby that's alright for you



</l>
<l>There's no need of you lyin', babe you know I've been good to you

</l>
<l>Yeah-eay, babe I've been good to you

</l>
<l>But if I leave you now, baby, go ahead and do what you wanna do



</l>
<l>You know I had a good woman and she was so kind and true

</l>
<l>Yeah, good woman, and she was so kind and true

</l>
<l>I even let her go, baby, on account of you, yes, I know



</l>
<l>Get offa my back, woman!



</l>
<l>But she's willin' to forgive me, so I'll leave it all up to you

</l>
<l>Hey, umm, leave it all up to you

</l>
<l>She told me when I was leavin', that your love wasn't really true</l></lyrics></xml>
