<lyrics>



Now lend me your love, little girl, please lend me your love

Lend me your love, baby, please lend me your love

I know you hear me keep moanin', moanin' just like Noah's dove



You got a mortgage on my love, girl, there really is no doubt

You got a mortgage on my love, girl, there really is no doggone
doubt

But someday I be lucky enough to find another woman,

gonna buy your love mortgage out</lyrics></xml>
