Well, you take my money, you call it chicken feed

take my money and you throw it around

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it,

throw my money around?



Well I work hard ever'day,

as a man s'pose to do

take my money, bring it home to you

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it,

throw my money around?



I done 'round? Yes, yes

I done told you once,

I ain't gon' tell you no more

Next time I tell you,

I got to let you down

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it,

throw my money around?



Well, my mama told her papa,

told me too

If you weren't no good for me,

why don't'cha' let you go

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it,

throw my money around?



Hmm

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it?

Baby, how can you do it,

throw my money around?
