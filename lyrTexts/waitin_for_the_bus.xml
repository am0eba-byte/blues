<lyrics>



Have mercy, been waitin' for the bus all day

Have mercy, been waitin' for the bus all day

I got my brown paper bag and my take-home pay



Have mercy, old bus be packed up tight

Have mercy, old bus be packed up tight

Well, I'm glad just to get on and home tonight



Right on, that bus done got me back

Right on, that bus done got me back

Well, I'll be ridin' on the bus till I Cadillac</lyrics></xml>
