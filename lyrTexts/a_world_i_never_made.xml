<lyrics>



The late show is over

And the city is fast asleep

And I'm lost in a world

That's just too cold and deep

I've turned so many ways

I'm spinning like a top

I wish that I could get off

Or get this world to stop



I'm a stranger and afraid

I'm a stranger and afraid

I'm a stranger and afraid

In a world I never made



I'm always chasing dragons

With a sword that's made of tin

So I know in my soul

There's no way I can win

I tried, oh I tried

But there's no place, no place to go

There's no one here who knows me

And no one here I know



I'm a stranger and afraid

I'm a stranger and afraid

I'm a stranger and afraid

In a world I never made</lyrics></xml>
