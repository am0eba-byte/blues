Mustang Sally, guess you better slow your mustang down

Mustang Sally, now baby, guess you better slow your mustang down

Ridin' all over town, woo, guess I'm gonna have to put your flat feet
on the ground



Mustang Sally, you better slow that mustang down

Mustang Sally, now baby, ya better slow you Mustang down

Runnin' all over town, woo, guess I'm gonna have to put your flat
feet on the ground



All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

Ooh, all ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

(One of these days)

Gonna have to wipe your weepin' eyes



All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

(One of these days)

Gonna be wipin' your weepin' eyes
