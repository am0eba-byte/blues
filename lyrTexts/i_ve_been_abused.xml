<lyrics>


<l>All my life, I've caught it hard

</l>
<l>All of my life, I have caught it hard

</l>
<l>I've been abused, and I've been scorned



</l>
<l>I feel so bad, it ain't gonna last

</l>
<l>I feel so bad, this ain't gonna last

</l>
<l>I've been scorned, and I've been kicked out



</l>
<l>I've been abused, I've been talked about

</l>
<l>I've been abused, I've been talked about

</l>
<l>I've been scorned, sure as you born



</l>
<l>I'm so mad, I can shout

</l>
<l>I'm so mad, I can shout

</l>
<l>I've been abused, and I've been kicked out</l></lyrics></xml>
