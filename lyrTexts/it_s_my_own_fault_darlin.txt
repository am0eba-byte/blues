It's my own fault darlin', that you treat me the way you
do

It's my own fault darlin', caused you treat me the way you do

When you left me darlin', I was callin' from town to town



Ooh, won't you give me one more chance

Ooh baby, won't you give me one more chance

Baby, I'll prove that I'm in love with you, you know I'll be
travelin' no more



It's my own fault darlin', I made you treat me the way you do

It's my own fault darlin', I made you treat me the way you do

Baby I go alone, I just realized, all I did



Oh goodbye baby, I know we may never meet again

Oh goodbye baby, I know we may never meet again

But it's my own fault darlin', I made you treat me the way you
did
