<lyrics>



Someone really loves you

Guess who

Guess who

S'open your heart,

oh, then surely you'll see,

oh, that someone who really cares is me



Someone will wait eternally

Someone who'll want your love,

oh so desp'rately

Open your heart,

oh, the surely you'll see,

oh, that the someone who really cares,

who really cares is me</lyrics></xml>
