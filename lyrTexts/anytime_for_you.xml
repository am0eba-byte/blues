<lyrics>


<l>I trusted in you, right from the start

</l>
<l>You messed around until you broke my heart

</l>
<l>Anytime for you, and all the time for me

</l>
<l>Someday you're gonna be sorry, the way you treated me



</l>
<l>You leave me in the mornin', come home late at night

</l>
<l>Well, have a nerve to tell 'em, that you treated me right

</l>
<l>Anytime for you and all the time for me

</l>
<l>Babe, you're gonna be sorry, the way you treated me



</l>
<l>You is a liar and a cheater, too

</l>
<l>The things you do to me, is coming home to you

</l>
<l>Anytime for you, and all the time for me

</l>
<l>You gonna be sorry, the way you treated me



</l>
<l>Pick 'em boy, pick 'em!



</l>
<l>Pack up your clothes an' get out of my flat

</l>
<l>And let my doorknob hit you in your back

</l>
<l>Anytime for you, and all the time for me

</l>
<l>You gonna be sorry, the way you treated me</l></lyrics></xml>
