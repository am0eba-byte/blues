<lyrics>


<l>I went down 13 Highway, drivin' a brand new V8 Ford

</l>
<l>I went down 13 Highway, drivin' a brand new V8 Ford

</l>
<l>Oh you know I was drivin' so fast, baby I couldn't hardly see the

road




</l>
<l>Oh I was drivin' 60 miles an hour, all up and down the hill

</l>
<l>Oh you know I was drivin' 60 miles an hour, all up and down the
hill

</l>
<l>Oh you know I was speedin' so fast, I couldn't hardly control my

wheel




</l>
<l>Don't the highway look lonesome, after the sun done gone down

</l>
<l>Oh don't the highway look lonesome, after the sun done gone down

</l><l>Oh you know you're all alone by yourself, there ain't nobody else</l>
<l>around</l></lyrics></xml>
