<lyrics>



Look over here, look over there

Look all around me everywhere

Well it doesn't really matter,

which way I wanna go

'Cause the night is a fallin',

and I'm a long long way from home

I am a long long way from home, yes I am



Listen to this, listen to that,

people tryin' to tell me

Where it's at,

but it really doesn't matter

I hear it all the time,

and I'm standing at the crossroads

'Bout to move on down the line,

about to move on down the line



Well I've been over here, been over there

Friends all around me everywhere,

but it really doesn't matter

Which way I wanna go,

I'm a million miles from nowhere

And that's a long long way from home

And that's a long long way from home



Yeah a million miles from nowhere

And that's a long long way from home

And that's a long long way from home</lyrics></xml>
