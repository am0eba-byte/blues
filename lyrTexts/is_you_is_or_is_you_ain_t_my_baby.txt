I gotta a girl who's always late

Anytime we have a date

But I love her

Yes I love her

I'm gonna walk up to her gate

And see if I can get it straight



'Cause I want her

I'm gonna ask her

Is you is, or is you ain't, my baby

The way you're acting lately makes me doubt

You is still my baby, baby



Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A woman is a creature that has always been strange

Just when you're sure of one you find

She's gone and made a change

Is you is, or is you ain't my baby



Maybe baby's found somebody new

Or is my baby still my baby true
