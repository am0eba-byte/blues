<lyrics>


<l>I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind

</l>
<l>I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind

</l>
<l>Is to leave my baby, 'cause she treat me so unkind



</l>
<l>I'm going down to the station, catch that old first mail train I
see

</l>
<l>I'm going down to the station, catch that old first mail train I
see

</l>
<l>I got the blues 'bout miss so-and-so, and her son's got the blues

about me




</l>
<l>I got mean things, I got mean things all on my mind

</l>
<l>Lil girl, lil girl, I got mean things all on my mind

</l>
<l>Is to leave my baby, 'cause she treat me so unkind
