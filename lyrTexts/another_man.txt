Another man done gone

Another man done gone

Another man done gone, another man done gone, another man done
gone



On the country farm

He's on the country farm, on the country farm, he's on the country
farm



Another man done gone

Another man done gone, another man done gone, another man done
gone

Didn't know his name, I didn't know his name, I didn't know his
