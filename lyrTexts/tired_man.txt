I'm a tired man

I ain't got time to play

Yeah ya know, I'm a tired man, tired man

You know I ain't got time to play

You know I'll always love ya baby

You know I'll love you ev'ry night and ev'ry night and ev'ry day



I have to fix my breakfast and dinner, baby

I have to do it ev'ry day

Yes, I'm gonna fix my breakfast and dinner, woman

I have to do it ev'ry day

When I come home from work

You know I got to watch your, watch your T.V. play



I'm a tired man

You know I ain't got time to play

Yeah, you know I'm a tired man, tired man, tired man

I ain't got time to play

I want you to know I'm still lovin' you baby

Ev'ry night and ev'ry day
