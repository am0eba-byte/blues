If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm
talkin' about

If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm talkin'
about

I worked five long years for one woman, and she had the nerve to put
me out



I got a job at a steel mill, truckin' steel like a slave

I got a job at a steel mill, truckin' steel like a slave

For five long years every Friday, I went straight home with all of my
pay



If you ever been mistreated, you know just what I'm talkin' about

If you ever been mistreated, you know just what I'm talkin' about

I worked five long years for a woman, and she had the nerve to put me
out
