Oh, I'm so excited, think about you all the time

Yes I can't wait to see you baby

You really best of my mind,

You're so fine, wanna hold you all the time



Oh, when you touch me baby, tears of joy I'm crying

Oh, when you hold me, chills run up and down my spine

You're so fine, think about you all the time



Yes, I'm so excited, I met peace with the world

Oh, can this love be real?

I'm talking about my new, new love

You're so fine baby, wanna love you all the time



Hey, I'm so excited, don't know what you're doing myself

Oh, I'm so happy baby, don't need nobody else

You're so fine baby, think about you all the time



Yes, when I look in your eyes, you put me in a trance

Oh, I just shake all over baby, I fell like I wanna dance

You're so fine baby, wanna hold you all the time



How can this be a dream, can this really happen to me?

Oh, I surely loved at last, seems like a fantasy

You're so fine baby, wanna hold you all the time



Oh, I thought I've been in love, so many many times

Oh, but this new love, has really messed up my mind

You're so fine, think about you all the time



You're so nice and lovin', everything you do it right

I just can't wait, I can't wait baby

Can't wait for you hold me tight

Youre so fine, wanna hold you all the time
