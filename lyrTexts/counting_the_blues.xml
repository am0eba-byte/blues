Layin' in bed this mornin' with my face turned to the wall

Layin' in bed this mornin' with my face turned to the wall

Trying to count these blues so I could sing 'em all




Memphis, Ramport, 

Beale Street set 'em, free


Memphis, Ramport,

Beale Street set 'em, free


Graveyard 'Bama Bound, Lord, Lord, come from stingaree



Lord sittin' on the Southern
1
 gonna ride all night long

Lord sittin' on the Southern 

gonna ride all night long


Downhearted, Gulf Coast - they was all good songs



Lord, 'rested at midnight, Jailhouse made me loose my mind

Lord, 'rested at midnight, Jailhouse made me loose my mind


Bad Luck 'n' Boll-Weevil, made me think of old Moonshine



Lord, goin' to sleep now for Mama just got bad news

Lord, goin' to sleep now for Mama just got bad news

To try to dream away my troubles, countin' these blues
