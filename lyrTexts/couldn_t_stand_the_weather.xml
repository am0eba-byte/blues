<lyrics>



Runnin' through this business of life,

rarely time if I'm needed to

Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right,

then daddy's hand helps to see me through

Sweet as sugar love won't wash away,

rain or shine, it always here to stay

All these years you and I've spent together,

all this, we just couldn't stand the weather



Like a train that stops at every station,

we all deal with trials and tribulations

Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years,

entangled in yellow and cries all his tears

Changes come before we can grow,

learn to see them before we're too old

Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy,

understand, it's time to get ready for the storm
