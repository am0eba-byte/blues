Around the bend in the L&N
1

They loaded it down with a lot of men

The whistle blow and through the switch
2

Nobody knew just-a which one switch

I'm ridin', ridin on the L&N

I ain't 
jivin'
, ridin' on
the L&N



Well a man named Quin on the L&N

Runnin'
3
 around on how she's been

Train slowed down and the men jumped off

I wasn't dead 'cause I heard him callin'

I'm ridin', ridin' on the L&N

I ain't jivin', ridin' on the L&N



A man named Mose with a great big nose

Sleepin' on that pile of toes

The doctor came and he rang the bell

The palla alla
4
 get well, well, well

I'm ridin', ridin' on the L&N

I ain't jivin', ridin' on the L&N



(Spoken: Walter Trout on guitar!)

necessary connections and designed to turn a locomotive or train from

Notes 3 and 4: Runnin' and "palla alla" these parts of the transcript
are still very questionable, suggestions are 
welcome
