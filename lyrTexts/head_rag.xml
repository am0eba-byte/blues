<lyrics>


<l>Here she come, yeah, with that head rag on

</l>
<l>There she go, yeah, with that head rag on

</l>
<l>Here she come, with that head rag on



</l>
<l>If you're walkin' down the street, wavin', ev'rybody see me

</l>
<l>Sayin' "hello there", walkin' in her stockin' feet

</l>
<l>Here she comes (ooo), with that head rag on



</l>
<l>Stayin' out all night long



</l>
<l>Talkin' 'bout anything



</l>
<l>Doin' ev'rything wrong, girl, oh oh



</l>
<l>Here she come, yeah, that head rag on

</l>
<l>There she goes, yeah yeah, with her head rag on

</l>
<l>Here she come, with that head rag on



</l><l>Eeow!</l></lyrics></xml>
