Well, the first thing Monday mornin', I drink black coffee, to clear
my head

Yes, every Monday mornin', I drink black coffee, an a-clear my
head

Because, ev'ry Sunday night without you, baby, it's Blue Monday, you
know baby, you know my soul is dead



Big Boss Man, I can hear you call my name, yes, Big Boss Man, Big
Boss Man

Oh, I can hear you call my name

You know, I just don't feel like it this mornin', baby, it's a sin,
you know ain't it a sin?



Hey!



I can hear Blue Monday callin', but this old hangover, just won't let
me go

Yes, I can hear Blue Monday callin', but this old hangover, just
won't let me go

Yes, but ev'ry time I try to get up, baby, I feel like I'm just goin'
down slow
