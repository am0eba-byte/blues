<l>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey mama look at little sis

</l>
<l>Out in the backyard, playin' like this

</l>
<l>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at little sister

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister



</l>
<l>What about the neighbors, what they gonna say

</l>
<l>Stop little sister, gettin' carried away

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey, look at little sister

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister



</l>
<l>Shakin' like a tree, rollin' like a log

</l>
<l>Shakin' and a rollin' now, that ain't all

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey, look at little sister

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister



</l>
<l>Shakin' like a tree, rollin' like a log

</l>
<l>Shakin' and a rollin' now, that ain't all

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey, look at little sister

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister



</l>
<l>What about the neighbors, what they gonna say

</l>
<l>Stop little sister, gettin' carried away

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey, look at little sister

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister</l></lyrics></xml>
