She got to take sick and die one of these days

She got to take sick and die oh! one of these days

All the medicine I can buy, and all the doctors she can hire

She got to take sick and die one of these days



When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep

When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep

I'm gonna bury her very deep, rubies and diamonds round her feet

She got to take sick and die one of these days



I got to take sick and die one of these days

She got to take sick and die oh! one of these days

All the medicine she can buy, and all the doctors she can hire

She got to take sick and die one of these days



She got to take sick and die one of these days

She got to take sick and die one of these days

All the medicine she can buy, and all the doctors she can hire

She got to take sick and die one of these days



If it was me and all the powers in my hands

If it was me and all the powers in my hands

If it was me and all the powers laying there child in my hands

She would have to go down to the promised land
