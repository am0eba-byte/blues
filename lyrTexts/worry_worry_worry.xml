<lyrics>



Well, worry, worry, worry, baby, worry's all I can do

Well, worry, worry, worry, woman, worry's all I can do

Yes, my life is so miserable, baby, woman, it is all on account of
you



Yes, it hurts me, it hurts me so bad, when you said we were
through

Yes, it hurts me, it hurts me so bad, woman. when you said, when you
said we were through

Yes, uh, you know I'd rather be dead, woman, woman than to be here
lonesome and blue

It was so lonely, somebody



Goodbye, baby, oh, you know I sure had a wonderful time

Oh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye babe

Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, we sure had a wonderful time

You know you're gonna run me crazy, darlin' are you gonna make me
loose my doggone mind</lyrics></xml>
