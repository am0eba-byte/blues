<lyrics>


<l>I am sitting here thinking and your thoughts make me feel so
sad

</l>
<l>I am sitting here thinking and your thoughts make me feel so sad

</l>
<l>I've searched eleven long years for love, yeah, searchin' for

something I already had




</l>
<l>When I think of what the old folks say, I can't help but cry

</l>
<l>When I think of what the old folks say, umm, I can't help but cry

</l>
<l>They have told me so often, you never miss your water, 'til the well

goes dry




</l>
<l>From now on, I'll try and do the things I should

</l>
<l>From now on, I'll try and do the things I should

</l><l>Let's take a chance on that old sayin', it's never too late to be</l>
<l>good</l></lyrics></xml>
