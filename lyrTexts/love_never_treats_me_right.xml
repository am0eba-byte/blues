<lyrics>


<l>Have you ever said now he's the one?

</l>
<l>I'm gonna love this man until I'm ninety-one

</l>
<l>Oo-ee baby love is out of sight

</l>
<l>I said love just never treats me right



</l>
<l>I'll love this man until I'm ninety-two

</l>
<l>but oh lord what's a girl to do?

</l>
<l>I love this man with all my might

</l>
<l>but love just never treats me right



</l>
<l>I love this man with all my heart and soul

</l>
<l>I love this man from head to toe

</l>
<l>well I love this man with all my might

</l>
<l>Why won't love ever treat me right?



</l>
<l>I'll love this man until I'm ninety-three

</l>
<l>but oh lord he's done some hurtin' on me

</l>
<l>Me and my baby we fuss and fight

</l>
<l>I said why won't love ever treat me right?

</l>
<l>I said why won't love ever treat me right?

</l>
<l>Why won't love ever treat me right?</l></lyrics></xml>
