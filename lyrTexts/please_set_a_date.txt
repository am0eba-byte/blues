Hey baby, baby please set a date

Hey baby, baby please set a date

Well, don't say tomorrow

'Cause tomorrow is too far away



Now, when I want some lovin'

I really want it bad

But the way you've been doin' baby

You really makes me mad

Hey baby, baby please set a date

Well, don't say tomorrow

'Cause tomorrow is too far away



Now, when I want some lovin'

My face gets full of frowns

Now baby, if you don't hurry

I'm going to leave your town

Hey baby, baby please set a date

Well, don't say tomorrow

'Cause tomorrow is too far away



Now, when we first met, baby

We swore we wouldn't part

But the way you're doin' me lately

You're really breakin' my heart

Hey baby, baby please set a date

Well, don't say tomorrow

'Cause tomorrow is too far away
