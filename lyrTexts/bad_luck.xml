<lyrics>


<l>Well, my bad luck is falling, falling down like rain

</l>
<l>Bad luck is falling, falling down like rain

</l>
<l>No matter what I do, seems like my luck won't never change



</l>
<l>I felt kinda lucky

</l>
<l>My luck was running slow

</l>
<l>The last hand I caught four aces

</l>
<l>And the police broke down the door

</l>
<l>I said, Lord, Lord, what can a poor boy do?

</l>
<l>Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money

</l>
<l>Seems like all the bad breaks will come to you



</l>
<l>Yeah, I got home this morning

</l>
<l>She was looking kinda funny

</l>
<l>She said "Don't come in, daddy

</l>
<l>Daddy, unless you got some money"

</l>
<l>And I said, Lord, Lord, what can a poor boy do?

</l>
<l>Well, ain't it tough when you can't make no money

</l>
<l>Without your woman turning her back on you



</l>
<l>Well now, I asked my woman for some dinner

</l>
<l>She looked at me like a fool

</l>
<l>She said, "I'm playing checkers, daddy

</l>
<l>And I think it's your turn to move"

</l>
<l>I said, oh, Lord, what can a poor boy do?

</l>
<l>Yes, it's bad when you can't make no money

</l>
<l>And your woman turns her back on you</l></lyrics></xml>
