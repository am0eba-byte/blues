<lyrics>



Everyday, everyday I have the blues

Everyday, everyday I have the blues

You see me worryin', it's you I hate to lose



Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Yes, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Making up worries and troubles there,

you know I'll having my share</lyrics></xml>
