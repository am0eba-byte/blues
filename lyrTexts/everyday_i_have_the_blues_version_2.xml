<l>Everyday, everyday I have the blues

</l>
<l>Everyday, everyday I have the blues

</l>
<l>You see me worryin', it's you I hate to lose



</l>
<l>Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

</l>
<l>Yes, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

</l>
<l>Making up worries and troubles there,

</l>
<l>you know I'll having my share</l></lyrics></xml>
