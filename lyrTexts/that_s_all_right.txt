You told me baby, once upon a time

If I'd be yours, little girl you'd be mine

But that's all right, I know you lovin' some other man

But that's all right

Well now, then I wonder, who's lovin' you tonight?



You told me baby, your love for me was strong

But I woke up this mo'nin', your big worries was gone

But that's all right

I know you're lovin' some other man, but that's all right

Well now, then I wonder, who's lovin' you tonight?



When I was lovin' you, just couldn't understand

Now you've gone and left me, for some other man

That' all right, I know you lovin' some other man

But that's all right

Well now, then I wonder, who's loving you tonight?
