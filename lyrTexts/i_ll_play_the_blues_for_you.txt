If you're down and out and you feel real hurt

Come on over to the place where I live

And all your loneliness I'll try to soothe

I'll play the blues for you



Don't be afraid come on in

You might run across some of your old friends

All your loneliness I gotta soothe

I'll play the blues for you



I got no big name and I ain't no big star

I play the blues for you on my guitar

All your loneliness I'll try to soothe

I 'll play the blues for you
