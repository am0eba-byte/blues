<lyrics>



Walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll on

You'd better walk right in and stay a little while, daddy, you can't
stay too long

Now everybody's talkin' 'bout your new way of walkin', do you wanna
lose your mind?

Lord, walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll
on



Walk right in and sit right down, and daddy, let your hair hang
low

You'd better walk right in and stay a little while, daddy, you can
stay too long

Now everybody's talkin' 'bout a new way of walkin', do you wanna lose
your mind?

Lord, walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll
on



Walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll on

You'd better walk right in and stay a little while, daddy, you can't
stay too long

Now everybody's talkin' 'bout a two-way woman, do you wanna lose your
mind?

You'd better walk right in, sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll
on!</lyrics></xml>
