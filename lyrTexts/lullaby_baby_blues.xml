Lullaby baby blues

Time to kick off your walkin' shoes

And hug the pillow on your bed

And lay down your sleepy head



Hush now no need to talk

Hear the ticking of the clock

Stars that twinkle, stars that shine

Dream and you'll have wings



Goodnight baby blues

Close your eyes baby blues

The moonlit sky watches over you

So close your eyes baby blues



Lullaby baby blues

Time to kick off your walkin' shoes

And hug the pillow on your bed

And lay down your sleepy head



Goodnight baby blues

Close your eyes baby blues

The moonlit sky watches over you

Close your eyes baby blues</lyrics></xml>
