You don't know how much I love you

You don't know how much I care

You don't know how much I need you

Without you life I can't bear

You don't know

You don't know baby

You don't know how much I love you

And you can't know just how I feel



The flame is still burnin'

Burnin' deep down in my soul

When I think of your love and kisses

It makes my blood run cold

You don't know baby

You don't know baby

Yes you don't know how much I love you

And you can't know just how I feel



All my friends call me crazy

For acting the way that I do

But I just can't help myself

'Cause I'm so in love with you

You don't know

Yes baby you don't know

You don't know how much I love you

And you can't know just how I feel



You don't know

You don't know

You don't know baby

You don't know

You don't know

You don't know baby

You don't know



Yes you don't know how much I love you

And you can't know just how I feel
