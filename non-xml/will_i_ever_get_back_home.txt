Cryin' Lord, I wonder will I, ever ooo get back ho-ooome ?

Cryin' Lord, I wonder will I, ever ooo get back ho-ooome ?

I wonder ooo, will I ever ooo-hoo get back ho-ooome?



Said I walked and I'm wondering, cryin' all night lo-oong

Said I walked and I'm wondering, cryin' all night lo-oong

Cryin' I wonder ooo, will I ever ooo-hoo, get back ho-oome?



So many days I done traveling, way-sided more

So many days I done traveling, way-sided more

Wonder if possible, ooo, will I ever, ooo get back ho-oome?



(It'll get better)



You will never ever, see me any more

You will never ever, see me any more

But you'll never ooo, forget the day, I knocked hoo-ooo on your
door



And Lord, I wonder will I, ooo-ooo ever get back ho-oome?

Cryin' Lord I wonder will I, ooo-ooo ever get back ho-oome?

Cryin' I wonder ooo, will I ever, ooo-hoo, get back home?
