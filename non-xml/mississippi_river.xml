(Spoken: Ready?)



Well, I'm going down that Mississippi River, yes, I am, yes I am

Well, I'm going down that Mississippi River, yes, I am, yes I am

Yes I am, boy, yes I am



Well, I'm goin' on that big Belle Louise, yes, I am, yes I am

Well, I'm going on that big Belle Louise, yes, I am, yes I am

Yes I am, boy, yes I am



Oh man, where are you gonna catch your river, catch me tryin', you
catch me tryin'

Oh man, where are you gonna catch your river, you catch me tryin',
you catch me tryin'

You catch me tryin', boys, you catch me tryin'



Man, will your daughter take on me?

Well, I don't know, I don't know

Oh man, will your daughter take on me?

I don't know, I don't know

I don't know, boy, I don't know



Well, I'm going down that Mississippi River, yes, I am, yes I am

Well, I'm going down that Mississippi River, yes, I am, yes I am

Yes I am, boy, yes I am
