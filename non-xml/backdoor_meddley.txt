I - Backdoor Love Affair



Got to have you, baby, even though you say that you don't care

Got to have you, baby, even though you say that you don't care

Any way you want it, settle for a backdoor love affair



II - Mellow Down Easy



Jump, jump here, jump, jump there, jump, jump, baby, everywhere

Don't you mellow down easy, babe, you got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy, babe

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy

Mellow down easy when you really wanna blow your top



Shake, shake here, shake, shake there, shake, shake, baby,
everywhere

Don't you mellow down easy, babe, you got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy, babe

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy

Mellow down easy when you really wanna blow your top



Shake, shake here, shake, shake there, shake, shake, baby,
everywhere

Don't you mellow down easy, babe, you got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy, babe

Don't you mellow down easy, got to mellow down easy

Don't you mellow down easy

Mellow down easy when you really wanna blow your top

IV - Long Distance Boogie



Is everybody feelin' good? You makin' us feel good, too!

Now, early this morning I got on that long distance telephone and I
called my mama

I said, "Mama, this is your boy, and I'm way down here in New
Orleans, Louisiana"

And she said, "That's all right, boy"

And she turned to my papa and she said, "Papa, our boy's way down
there in New Orleans

We cannot let him stay out all night long"

She did!

Long about that time, I heard my papa lean toward my mama

I heard papa tell mama, "Let that boy boogie-woogie"

He said, "It's in him and it's got to come out"



So I went downtown

There's a lot of people there

They was-a really havin' a ball

And I felt so good

Yes, I felt so good

Yes, I felt so good

Yes, I felt so good

Yes, I felt so good

Yes, I felt so good

Yes, I felt so good



Boogie, children!



Boogie, children!
