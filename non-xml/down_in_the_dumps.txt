<lyrics>



My man's got somethin', he gives me such a thrill

Every time he smiles at me, can't keep my body still

I done cried so much, look like I've got the mumps


I can't keep from worryin' 'cause I'm down in the
dumps
2



I had a nightmare last night, when I laid down

When I woke up this mornin', my sweet man couldn't be found

I'm goin' down to the river, into it I'm goin' to jump

Can't keep from worryin' 'cause I'm down in the dumps



Someone knocked on my door last night when Inbsp;was asleep

I thought it was that sweet man of mine makin' his 'fore day
creep

Wasn't nothin' but my landlord, a great big chump

Sat 'way from my door Mr. landlord, 'cause I'm down in the dumps



When I woke up my pillow was wet with tears

Just one from that man o' mine seems like a thousand years

But I'm gonna straighten up, straighter than Andy Gump

Ain't no use of me tellin' that lie 'cause I'm down in the dumps



I'm twenty-five years old, that ain't no old maid

I got plenty of vim and vitality, I'm sure that I can make the
grade

I'm always like a tiger, I'm ready to jump

I need w whole lot's of lovin' 'cause I'm down in the dumps
