I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin', I said runnin' in your
arms



Don't the moon look lonesome, when it's shinin' down through the
trees

Don't the moon look lonesome, when it's shinin' down through the
trees

Don't my, don't my man looks fine, when he comes runnin', runnin'
after me



I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone, honey when I'm
gone

Say now, I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin', I said runnin' in your
arms!



I know you rider. you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Yeah, you're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin', oh, I said runnin'
in your arms!



And I know my baby, says he's bound to love me so, love me so

Said I, I know my baby, and he's bound to love me so

You know he'll close his arms around me, like a circle, he thinks
I'll understand



I know you rider

Said you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
