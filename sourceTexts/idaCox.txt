Mister radio announcer, please listen to my plea
Mister radio announcer, please listen to my plea
Tune in on your radio, and find my man for me

I think you might find him, walking down some lonely road
I think you might find him, walking down some lonely road
Please call him for me, move my heart this heavy load

Call every station, call every ship at sea
Call every station, call every ship at sea
'Cause I'll give the world, to get him back to me

I walked the floor, till I worn out all my shoes
I walked the floor, till I worn out all my shoes
Announce to the world, I've got those broadcasting blues

Come here pretty papa, sit down on your mama's knee
Come here pretty papa, sit down on your mama's knee
I don't want to tell you how you have mistreated me

You leave me after supper and you don't come home till morn'
You leave me after supper and you don't come home till morn'
You'll come home some morning and find your cherry tree gone

You can't slip back to your brownskin, I mean your used-to-be
You can't slip back to your brownskin, I mean your used-to-be
I know you're crazy 'bout your cherry pie but you can't two-time me

I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town
I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town
Goodbye little papa, another man has cut your cherry tree down

I'm goin' to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you
Yes I'm goin' to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you
'Cause there's nothin' on State Street, that a monkey man can do

I've got a monkey man here, a monkey man over there
I've got a monkey man here, a monkey man over there
If monkey men were money, I'd be a Chicago millionaire

I've got fourteen men now, I only want one more
I've got fourteen men now, and I only want one more
As soon as I can get one, I'll let these fourteen go

Now I'm goin' tell you, like the day goes so must you
Now I'm goin' tell you, like the day goes so must you
When you nobody no money, mama can no usin' you

I can take my monkey men, and stand them all in line
I can take my monkey men, and stand them all in line
Anybody can count them, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight times



Coffin Blues

Daddy, oh daddy won't you answer me please?
Daddy, oh daddy won't you answer me please?
All day I stood by your coffin tryin' to give my poor heart ease

I run1 my hands over your head and whispered in your ear
I run1 my hands over your head and whispered in your ear
And I wonder if you know that your mama is near

You told me that you love me and I believe what you said
You told me that you love me and I believe what you said
And I wish that I could fall here across your coffin dead

When I left the undertaker, I couldn't help but cry
When I left the undertaker, I couldn't help but cry
And it hurt me so bad, to tell the man I love goodbye
