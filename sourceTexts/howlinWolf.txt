Be careful what you're drivin', man
That Cadillac may get away, you better be careful!

There standin' the highway man, standin' parked on the road
There standin' there highway man, parked on the road
You better watch out for the red light, just before you go

Green light says go, red light says stop
Look-a-here boy, you better be on your watch
There's standin' a highway man, parked on the side of the road
You better be careful, 'bout how you drive on the road
Stop!

I love the Cadillac, long wreckin' machine
I love a Cadillac, it's a long wreckin' machine
Me an my baby can ride it, ev'rything is nice 'til then
(Yeah!)

I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas
I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas
I'm gonna drive this automobile, just as long as the gas lasts
(Play it!)

Look-it-here man, please check this oil
Look-it here man, please check this oil
Just a long Cadillac, bound to try out your soil

I'm got to change my way of livin', this life I'm livin' ain't no good
I'm got to change my way of livin', this life I'm livin' ain't no good
I leave home in the morning, don't come back 'til the break of dawn

My baby said that ain't right, I'll admit that is true
My baby said that ain't right, I'll admit that is true
She said daddy, daddy, you got to change the way you do

You know I leave in the mornin', and I don't come back 'til dawn
You know I leaves in the mornin', and I don't come back 'til dawn
My baby looked me in the eyes, and said daddy, you got to change your evil way

You're a mean mistreater, mama, you don't mean me no good
You just a mean-mistreater mama, you don't mean me no good
I can't blame you, baby, I'd be the same way if I could

You know in the mo'nin', baby, when I come 'n, knocked on your door
You had a nerve to tell me, that you don't want me no more

And then also baby, when I knocked upon your door
You had a nerve to tell me, don't want me no mo'

Didn't you say you was gonna leave me, did you say you was goin' away?
Did you say you was gonna leave me, didn't you say you was goin' away?
That's alright baby, you gonna come back home someday

Oh you just my color, oh you just my kind
Oh you just my color, oh you just my kind
Lord, you keep me worried babe, oh, messed up in mind

Well, I got up last night, reachin' upside the wall
I got up last night (that he was), teachin' upside the wall
Lord, I love my baby, but I declare, ooo, she's the cause of it all

Don't know what to do, 'bout the trouble I have
Don't know what to do, 'bout the trouble I have
I might try to find me some rest, babe, in the world, somewhere

Well, my baby done left me, she don't know how I've cried
Well, my baby done left me, she don't know how I've cried
Lord, she's a pretty little girl, oh she's tryin'a wreck my life

I'm gonna leave you woman, before I commit a crime
I'm gonna leave you woman, before I commit a crime
You tried so hard to kill me, woman it just was not my time

You put poison in my coffee, instead of milk or cream
You put poison in my coffee, instead of milk or cream
You bout the evilest woman, that I ever seen

You mixed my drinks, with a can of Red Devil lye
You mixed my drinks, with a can of Red Devil lye
Then you sit down, watch me, hopin' that I might die
