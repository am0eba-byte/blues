Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go, down to New Orleans
You know I love you so

Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone

Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
I beg you all night long, baby, please don't go

You brought me way down here
You brought me way down here
You brought me way down here
'bout to Rolling Forks, you treat me like a dog

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go, back the New Orleans
I beg you all night long

Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone

You know your man down gone
You know your man down gone
You know your man down gone
To the country farm1, with all the shackles on



Blues Before Sunrise

from probably The Chess Box (MCA 80002), copyright notice

I have the blues before sunrise, tears standing in my eyes
I have the blues before sunrise, tears standing in my eyes
It was a miserable feeling, now babe,
A feeling I do despise

I have to leave, leave you baby, because you know you done me wrong
I have to leave you baby, because you know you done me wrong
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling
And break up my happy home

I'm gonna leave you baby, I'm gonna leave you all alone
I'm gonna leave you baby, I'm gonna leave you all alone
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling,
Because you know you done me wrong

Well now goodbye, goodbye baby, I'll see you on some rainy day
Well now goodbye baby, I'll see you on some rainy day
You can go ahead now little darling,
'Cause I want you to have your way

Hello canary bird, this is a letter home
Hello canary bird, this is a letter home
Well you know I want you to fly the whole world over
And find how my baby been gettin' along

Well canary bird, when you get to Clarksdale
Please fly down on Second Street
Yes canary bird when you get to Clarksdale
Please fly down on Second Street
Well you know I don't want you to stop flyin'
Until you take the letter out to Stovall for me

Fly on, canary bird, fly on!

On your way back home, please stop by Memphis a while
Yes on your way back home, please stop by Memphis a while
Well canary bird I want you to stroll down Beale Street
And see can you see my little old angel child

from One More Mile (MCA/Chess CHD2-9348), copyright notice

It's so cold up north, that a bird can hardly fly
Well it's so cold up north, that a bird can hardly fly
Now you know I'm goin' back down south, let this winter pass on by

Well I know my baby, don't know what a shape I'm in
Yeah I know my baby, she don't know what a shape I'm in
Now you know I ain't had me no lovin', people you know I ain't got no friend

Hmmm mmmm
Hmmm mmmm
Now you know I ain't had me no lovin', people you know ain't got no friend

Well I believe I go, further down the road
Yeah I believe I go, further down the road
Now you know I done stayed over here in Switzerland, people you know I done almost froze

Well if I could hold, hold my heart in my hand
Yeah if I could hold, hold my heart in my hand
You know I would show you pretty girls, just how to treat your man
