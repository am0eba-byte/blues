from Makin' Love Is Good for You (MCA 112241), copyright notice

You won't listen to nothing I tell you, baby, you keep on doing just as you please
Hey, you won't do nothing I tell you, baby, keep on doing as you please
I've taken as long as I can, baby, when is this foolishness gonna cease

I've worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day
I said I've worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day
You don't believe me, baby, but I'm gonna leave one of these days

Well, you told me that you love me, but actions speak louder than words
Oh, you said you love me, baby, but action speaks louder than words
I won't be fooled no longer, baby, that line everybody's heard

Well, If you're gonna change, baby, you better do it real soon
Hey, If you're gonna change, for the better, baby, you better do it real soon
Because you'll wake up one of these mornings, find yourself in a empty room

Don't care when you go, how long you stay
Good time treatments, bring you back someday
Oh but someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life any more

Ain't but one thing, give me the blues
When I've worn a hole, in my last pair of shoes
Oh but someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life any more

If I attend church all day Sunday, come back home and raise
(Spoken) I think I feel hurt or shall I go a little further, do a little more?
Ain't nobody's bizness what I do
If one day I have ham and bacon, and the next day, ain't nothin' shakin'
No it ain't nobody's bizness what I do



Ain't That Just Like A Woman
by Claude Demetrius / Fleecie Moore
recording of 1999
from Let the Good Times Roll: The Music of Louis Jordan (MCA 12042), copyright notice

There was Adam, happy as a man could be
Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Lot took his wife down to the corner for a malted
She wouldn't mind her business, boy, did she get salted

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
Samson thought Delilah was on the square
Till one night she clipped him all his hair

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

From our history books we all learned
Nero fiddled while Rome was burned

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Marie Antoinette met some hungry cats at the gate
They was crying for bread, she said, "Let them eat cake"

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

You can buy a woman clothes
And give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time



All You Ever Give Me Is The Blues
by probably Jon Tiven / Sally Tiven / Gary Nicholson
recording of 1995
from Lucille & Friends (MCA 33008), copyright notice

I gave you a diamond ring, you won't wear
It's a nine thousand dollar thing, you don't care
I set up a wedding date, you couldn't make it
You said all the love we made, you were just faking

But girl, you know, what hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you, all you ever give me
All you ever give me, all you ever give me is the blues
Is the blues

I gave you my Cadillac keys, you don't drive
I hired you a limousine, you won't ride
Bought you the house on the hill, you hate the view
Even wrote you into my will, gave you something to look forward to

But girl, you know, what hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever give me is the blues
Nothing but the blues

I've tried and tried, but I'm mystified
I've done all that I can do, I've given you my best
You put me to the test
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever give me is the blues
Nothing but the blues

But girl, you know, what hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever gave me was the blues
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me was the blues
Nothing but the blues

by B.B. King
recording of 1970

You go out when you get ready
And you come home when you please
You just love me when you want me baby
And you think it outta be alright with me

When I try to talk, talk to you baby
And let you know just how I feel
You tell me if I don't like it
You know someone else will

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
Oh so don't ask me no questions now baby
And I, I won't tell you no lies

Because I like to feel arms around me
And lips close, close to mine
So I don't have to beg you to love me
I don't have to beg you all the time

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
So now don't you ask me no questions
And you know I won't, I won't tell you no lies

Yes you can love me if you want me
Or you keep on playing the field
Because I know if you don't love me
I know there's somebody else that will



A Story Everybody Knows
by Nesbert "Stix" Hooper / Will Jennings
recording of 1979
from Take It Home (MCA 11770), copyright notice

Went to a party, the New York style
I met a lady, make a sane man wild
She said the words only her lips could say
She made me want to throw my life away
But when I asked her, she said, "Maybe tomorrow, B.B."
And that's a story everybody knows

I took her flying, out across the sea
I thought I had her, I know that she had me
And when we landed, it was Paris, France
Seemed like a nice place, for some French romance
But when I touched her, she said, "Maybe a little later, B.B."
And that's the story everybody knows

We went to Berlin, and to Stockholm too
And on the Moscow, then to the Peking Zoo
As far as travel, she couldn't get too much
Somewhere in Oakland, she let me have just a little touch
And then she said, "I'm late for beauty appointment,
I've got a headache, and I believe I'm coming down with the flu"
And that's the story everybody knows

Good mornin' baby, baby, welcome back, baby, welcome back to town

Well, because anytime I'm ready woman
Well, I can tell you, I can tell you, "Baby, get lost!"

You cheatin' on the outside, you're doin' ev'rything you chose

Alright!
Well, because anytime I'm ready, baby,
I can tell you, "Baby, get lost!"



Back In L.A.

from There Is Always One More Time (MCA MCAD-10295), copyright notice

From Hollywood and Vine
To the Sunset Strip
There's so much going on
You can lose your grip
From early in the morning
Until late at night
They'll do you so wrong
They'll do you so right

Back in L.A.
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in L.A.
Living down a life of crime
Back in L.A.
Working on another line
Back in L.A.
To pick up the dime
You must do the time

From way up in the canyons
Where the hot winds howl
To the mean city streets
Where the night hawks prowl
I can feel the rhythm play
The whole night long
Guess I'll stay in L.A.
And listen to this song

Back in L.A.
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in L.A.
Living down a life of crime
Back in L.A.
Working on another line
Back in L.A.
To pick up the dime
You must do the time

You must do the time



Bad Breaks

by B.B. King / Joe Josea
recording of 19
from , copyright notice

Oh, I wish I was single, 'cause my woman, she drives me mad
I wish I was single, 'cause my woman, she drives me mad
Yes, she's always accusing me of someone of someone I ain't never had

Last night I felt lucky but my luck was running slow
The last hand I caught four aces and the police broke down the door
I said, "Lord, Lord, what can a poor boy do?"
It's tough when you can't make no money,
seems like all the bad breaks come to you

Got home this morning, she was looking kind-a funny
She said, "Don't come in here daddy, unless you got some money"
I said, "Lord, Lord, what can a poor boy do?"
It's tough when you can't make no money,
seems like all the bad breaks come to you

I asked my woman for some dinner, she looked at me like a fool
She said, "I'm playing checkers, daddy, and I think it's your time to move"
I said, "Lord, Lord, what can a poor boy do?"
It's tough when you can't make no money,
seems like all the bad breaks come to you

from Blues on the Bayou (MCA 11879), copyright notice

Yes you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same
Hey you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same
Every now and then, baby, lady luck deals another hand

You're calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man
Hey you're calling me your pal now, baby, when I used to be your man
You're flying real high now, baby, go on and raise your sand

I realize now, baby, your kind of love ain't true
Hey I realize now, baby, your kind of love won't do
Well what should've been, baby, now has all fell through



Can't Get Enough
by Jerry Williams
recording of 1988
from King of Blues: 1989 (MCA MCAD-42183), copyright notice

I've been tossing and turning all night
Staring into the darkness
Afraid to turn on the light
It's got nothing to do with money
I just sure enough want you, honey
And I just can't rest
Till I get it right
'Cause when the morning breeze
Starts blowing
That's when you hear me call your name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious, baby
End of the game

'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love

You got me walking round in circles
Yeah I'm always pacing the floor
'Cause this life I'm living without you
I just can't take no more

When the morning breeze starts blowing
I can hear you call my name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious, baby
End of the game

'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love

'Cause when the morning breeze
Starts blowing
I can hear me call your name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious, baby
End of the game

'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love

I can't get enough of your love



Choo Choo Ch'Boogie
by Denver Darling / Milton Gabler / Vaughn Horton
recording of 1999
from Let the Good Times Roll: The Music of Louis Jordan (MCA 12042), copyright notice

Headin' for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of my hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
And hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack to pal around
With democratic fellow named Mac
So take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie, woo-woo
Woo-woo, ch'boogie, choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

You reach your destination but you don't go back
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situations from the front to the back
But the only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack, Jack

Choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie, woo-woo
Woo-woo, ch'boogie, choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

Gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life O'Riley in the beat down shack
When I hear a whistle I can peep thru the crack
Watch the train rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
Love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
So take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie, woo-woo
Woo-woo, ch'boogie, choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

Take me right back to the track, Jack
