Why get up why get up
How can I get up why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever why get up
Phone keeps ringing right off the hook
Some bill collector I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed dream all day
World outside bugs me anyway
When I get things going the going gets rough
So I ask myself why get up
Chorus
Went to the doctor he said lose some weight
If you don't do it quick we'll have to operate
I talked to my lawyer he said case is closed
That woman got it all even the garden hose
Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck
Better roll back over why get up
Chorus
Well I can't quit drinking I'm nervous all the time
When I wake up it's like a ton lead on my mind
What was it I said to that girl last night
She really got upset I best stay out of sight
I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff
I better duck under the cover why get up
Chorus
Chorus
I wonder why why do everything have to happen to me
I wonder why why do everything have to happen to me
Well I'm blue and I'm lonesome my heart is filled with misery
Oh so many strange things they happen to me all day long
Oh so many strange things they happen to me all day long
yes it seems like everything I do everything I do is wrong
I had a good reputation the greatest man in town
But I'm having so much troubles till they 'bout to drag me down
I wonder why why do everything have to happen to me
I wonder why why do everything have to happen to me
Well I'm blue and I'm lonesome my heart is filled with misery
I got up on my feet I had lots of friends
But bad luck had hit me now I'm down again
That's my baby in the white boots
That's my baby on the floor
That's my baby havin' some fun
And yellin' more more more
That's my baby in the short skirt
Wo out of control
Ah she becomes another woman
When she rocks & rolls
She's having a good time
Goin' round & round
She's really rippin' it up
You know she can't sit down oh no
That's my baby lookin' so good
You know I can't explain
How when she's dancing in the white boots
It makes her go insane
She's having a good time
Goin' round & round
She's really rippin' it up
You know she can't sit down oh no
That's my baby in the short skirt
With the white boots on
That's my baby in the white boots
That's my baby on the floor
That's my baby havin' some fun
And yellin' more more more
She's having a good time
Goin' round & round
She's really rippin' it up
You know she can't sit down oh no
That's my baby in the short skirt
With the white boots on

In the short skirt
With the white boots on
Can't explain
You know I can't explain
How when she's dancing in the white boots
It makes her go insane
White boots white boots
White boots white boots
No rocket's gonna fly that high
There's no escaping the enemy he's you and I
We poison up our water we're chokin' on the air
Last stop before it gets too late or is it already too late
Is it already too late
For the victims of comfort
Got no one else to blame
We're just the victims of comfort
We cannot soothe the pain
And it's a technological merry-go-round
Dangerous solutions buried under the ground
And everyone likes a party
But no-one wants to clean
Well I'd like to see a change somehow and I believe we're busy right now
Just a little busy right now
I am just a victim of comfort
I got no one else to blame
I'm just a victim of comfort
Cryin' shame
Boy what have we got to lose Everything
Yes and what do we stand to gain Everything so let's
Try together before we have to cry together
It's too soon to die together
I'm just a victim of comfort
Got no one else to blame
I'm just a victim of comfort
Got to soothe the pain
Be the victims of comfort
Got no one else to blame
I am just a victim of comfort
Cryin' shame
Baby baby you put the hurt on me
'Cause I was blind and just couldn't see
But all these rumours that are floating around
Make this big city a very small town
I found out you've got somebody else
But I love you baby and I just can't help myself
I can't let you got it's plain as day to see
I'm gonna have to let you two time me
You can two time my lovin'
Second hands love is better than none
You can two time my lovin'
Just come home when you've had your fun
Repeat chorus
After all everybody has their fun
Nobody feels like there beholding to anyone
They don't feel there's no more lessons to be learned
But when you rub two
together
Somebody's got to burn
But if you love somebody with all your might
You might have to fuss you might have to fight
Resign yourself there's nothing you can do
You're gonna have to let 'em two time you
chorus
But if you love somebody with all your might
You might have to fuss you might have to fight
Resign yourself there's nothing you can do
You're gonna have to let 'em two time you
Travelin' south tryin' to work my way back home
I said I'm headed south tryin' to work my way back home
I'm so broken an' hungry ain't no money for the telephone
Feet so tired I think I'm gonna lay down

Travelin' south tryin' to work my way back home

Ev'ry night and ev'ry day
One night while sleeping in my bed I had a beautiful dream
That all the people of the world got together on the same wavelength
and began helping one another
Now in this dream universal love was the theme of the day
Peace and understanding and it happened this way
The sick the hungry had smiles on their faces
the tired and the homeless had family all around
The streets and the cities were all beautiful places
and the walls came tumblin' down
People of the world all had it together
had it together for the boys and the girls
And the children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
I had a vision of blue skies from sea to shining sea
all the trees in the forest stood strong and tall again
Everything was clean and pretty and safe for you and me
the worst of enemies became the best of friends
People of the world all had it together
had it together for the boys and the girls
Children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
Remember that remember that
Remember that remember that
People of the world all had it together
had it together for the boys and the girls
Children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away

By the way you look at me
And what you're thinking brings happiness
Oh and it brings misery
Please please don't try to tell me
I think I I understand
No no don't try to tell me baby
'Cause I think I I understand
You want me to try and forget you
Well I'll do
Baby I'll do the best I can
You know it hurts you when you're in love with someone and you know that someone don't love you It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know that the someone that you're in love with is in love with your best friend And I'll tell you when someone else is rocking you rocking your cradle you know better than you can rock your cradle yourself then there's only one thing for you to do You just pack your clothes turn around and slowly walk out of the door Look over your left shoulder as you go out then you hang your head and you say:
Oh please don't try to tell me
Uh huh I think I understand
No no no no
Please don't try to tell me
Because you think you think I understand
Oh you want me to try
To try to forget you baby
And I'll tell you I'll do the best I can
You know after you have done all you could do and you can't take no more then you go downtown you get your big baseball bat and you come back on the scene where they both are still together and then you just go and kick down the door Now as you kick down the door you just start beating the hell of everybody that you can see everybody that comes through the door and just as you make up your mind that you're gonna try to forgive her then out comes another one of your friends and that really blows your mind So you go and think about you say to yourself baby I realize I've done wrong but please forgive me And with a smirky smile on her face then she look up at you and she say
If you ever think about me
Oh I think about you baby
If you ever charge your mind
Oh you're staying on my mind baby
If you ever think about me
Oh I think I think about you all the time
And if I ever cross your mind
You stay on my mind
Well you know you know
You know I'm yours
And I know I know you got to be mine
Yeah
There's something on your mind B
I can tell by the way you look at me
Oh there's something on my mind Miss James

Oh can you tell there's something on my mind
By the way you look at me
Oh the way I look at you you look good to me
And what you're thinking brings happiness
Yes baby
Oh and it can bring misery
Yes all right
If your whole life somehow
Wasn't much 'til now
And you've almost lost
Your will to live
No matter what you've been through
Long as there's breath in you
There is always one more time
And if your dreams go bad
Every one that you've had
That don't mean that some dreams
Can't come true
'Cause it's funny about dreams
As strange as it seems
There is always one more time
Oh turnin' corners
Is only a state of mind
Keeping your eyes closed
Is worse than being blind
If there's a heart out there
Looking for someone to share
I don't care if it's been
Turned down time and time again
And if we meet one day
Please don't walk away
'Cause there is always one more time
There is always one more time
The sky is cryin' look at the tears rollin' down the street
The sky is cryin' look at the tears rollin' down the street
I been lookin' for my baby I wonder where she can be
That's right
I saw my baby one mornin' and she was walkin' on down the street
I saw my baby one mornin' and she was walkin' on down the street
Yes she was
You know it hurt me so bad it made my poor heart skip a beat
Here we go play it for me
I've got a bad bad feelin' my baby don't love me no more
I've got a bad bad feelin' my baby don't love me no more no
The sky is cryin' woh look at the tears rolling down my nose
The sky is cryin' look at the tears rollin' down the street yeah
The sky is cryin' look at the tears rollin' down the street
I been lookin' for my baby I wonder where my baby can be
I said the moon is full I feel my love comin' down
I said the moon is full I feel my love comin' down
You see I met this little girl I don't think I'm gonna wanna wanna leave this town
All my friends call me crazy you just don't know how I feel inside
All my friends call me crazy you just don't know how I feel inside
You know I love this little girl 'cause she's got the little pretty pretty brown eyes
Gonna take that train in the mornin' I think I'm gonna go back home
Gonna catch that train in the mornin' ya'all I think I'm gonna go back home
And I know that my little girl know oh that I won't be gone I won't be gone 'till dawn
If I miss that train I think I'm gonna to have to hitch-hike
If I miss that train in the mornin' ya'all I guess I'm gonna have to hitch-hike
And I'll let my little girl know I'll just be gone I'll be gone
overnight
I keep laughing
Through the tears I cry
No way life is getting to me
We're all out there
Gotta live and die
No one's above it
May as well love it
Face the music
This is your time to dance
Let your life roll on
When they hit you
Just get up
And go another round
Oh baby don't you know
I know the lowdown
Everything that's going up
Must go down
Speed it up or slow down
Life's a merry-go-round
Ride it high
'Cause we all hit the ground
I had money
And it all slipped away
Guess I didn't really really need it
I can make it
Living day to day
Don't look for answers
Follow the dancers
Face the music
'Cause they're playing your tune
Let the night roll on
Take it from me
'Cause I've been the long
Long way around
Oh baby don't you know
I know the lowdown
Everything that's going up
Must go down
Speed it up or slow down
Life's a merry-go-round
Ride it high
'Cause we all hit the ground
Walkin' down
the king's highway
A paper bag in my hand
nothin' else but my clothes I got on
But I ain't a lookin' back
I ain't a lookin' back
I blame it on that midnight girl
a wicked spell she casts
She pulled me in with her lip but I
but I ain't a lookin' back
I ain't a lookin' back
Oh what a tangle
when she weeps
I was a losin' my mind
starin' down the barrel of a gun
It's just a matter of time
Yeah
Spoken:
I remember when I was snowed in and up at old Shire town
I'm sure the next tour take me right back through that town
Snow was up to your shoulders man and that ain't no lie
Chicago wasn't so cold it would make a polar bear cry
Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the hawk
Now I'm gonna tell ya somethin' that'll make you let out a squawk
Spoken:
Now where I live the weather's mostly warm
We don't have to worry about no snow or if we have a storm
But Shire town sits on the shores of a lake
and when that hawk flaps his wings it make you shiver an' shake
Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the hawk
Man I'm tellin' ya one thing they just let out a squawk
Spoken:
But man you should a been there in the winter of '
You couldn't catch a cab down on State and Lake
Now you know that's bad 'cause that's right in the heart of town
And it was so bad the mayor had to close the whole town down
Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the hawk
Oh man I tell you tell you let out a squawk
My baby gives me love
As good as love can be
I just leave her crying
When the blues come over me
Up on a mountain
I'm drowning in the sea
All the clocks say midnight
When the blues come over me
The blues come over me
I pack it up and go
The blues come over me
I catch the wind and blow
And some will take the wine
And some will take the night
When everything's all wrong
Then anything is all right
Some put in a song
And some sing it for their dues
Some go to sleep and wake up
Tangled in the blues
The blues come over me
I pack it up and go
The blues come over me
I catch the wind and blow
The blues come in a whisper
And make you scream and shout
And you'll do most anything
Just to let them out
I may think I'm happy
I may think I'm free
Nothing don't mean nothing
When the blues come over me
The blues come up behind
The blues wait up ahead
The blues ask why you are born
If you just end up dead
The blues talking about the blues
The blues oh the blues the blues
Talking about the blues
When the blues come over me
Talking about the blues
I have to go away
The blues the blues
When the blues come over me
I have to pack it up and go
Remember when we first met
I was so excited just to get to know you
Oh baby just to know you
I was just a little bit shy
God willing I was ready
To try to show you
Oh just to show you
I felt a little funny
But it was really no joke
I wanted to prove my love
In every word that I spoke
Chorus:
But the action
Speaks louder
You know the action
Speaks louder than
The word
The action
Louder than the word
I loved you just the way you were
Somehow I had to find the nerve to tell you
Oh baby just to tell you
So I did what a man must do
I walked right over to you
And I was asking
Baby lets go dancing
I felt a little guilty
But I had committed no crime
I wanted to love you
Love you and love you
For a long time
Chorus
Bridge:
I can't wait until I'm holding you
And there's no doubt in your mind
You're the one and only one for me
Only one for me
I'm gonna prove my love no matter how long that it takes
The feelings I have for you they're no mistake
Chorus
It ain't you
No it ain't me
That's not the way
Love's supposed to be
And it's just no good
No it ain't right
For you to be sitting all alone
Crying every night
You're down on your knees
Scared he's gonna leave
But if you really wanna know
You're gonna have to let go
Cause that's not love
Love don't feel that bad
That's not love
It don't feel that sad
No that's not love
'Cause you don't feel good inside
I don't know what it is
But that's not love
Inside your heart
It's always raining
And you're oh so tired
Tired of your own complaining
This is for real
It ain't no game
You can't measure your love
By the depths of your pain
One two three four
Let me tell you about the Texas blues
I went down south to Dallas to hear those cowboys wail
Came across that Billy Gibbons ridin' on that ZZ trail
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
Got myself in Double Trouble when I saw that Texas Flood
Stevie said The Sky Is Crying superstition's in his blood
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
How-how-how-how
Come on
I heard that Houston Twister he could run you off the tracks
When he plays that Cold Cold Feeling you get the shivers down your back
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
A-how-how-how-how
Well I'm going back to Dallas won't go waitin' for no bus
Ridin' off into the sunset you won't see my heels for dust
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
And I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
Texas blues
A-how-how-how-how
A-how-how-how-how

Oh yes sweet sixteen baby sweet sixteen oh yes
The sweetest thing baby oh yes
The sweetest thing I ever seen
You know I'm having so much trouble people
baby I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me
Sweet sixteen sweet sixteen oh yes
You know I'm having so much trouble people
Baby I wonder
Yes I wonder
Baby I wonder
I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Really blew my lid
Went to a party I recollect that much
But after four or five you know I lost my touch
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
I had a whale of good time last night
Really got myself some kicks
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Took me right back to the sticks
Between that hillbilly band and old Uncle Zeke
And that new atomic beverage that they called "Sneaky Pete"
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Don't know how I got to bed
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Come here feel this lump on my head
They say I got kinda noisy
And started to shout
Four big bouncers grabbed me
But I threw them out
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Really had myself some fun
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Didn't get home until about half past one
You know I'd like to take you with me the next time I go
But where the heck was it
Sure would like to know
But I sure had a wonderful time last night
Oh baby please stop messin' around you're messin' around with my heart
Baby please stop messin' around you're messin' around with my heart
And if you don't stop messin' baby pretty soon we're gonna have to part
Oh baby please stop messin' around you're messin' around all the time
Baby please stop messin' around you're messin' around all the time
And if you don't stop messin' baby you're gonna be someone else's baby not mine
Squeeze me baby till my face turn cherry red roll me so hard I'll fall right out of bed
Please stop messin' around you're messin around all the time
If you don't stop messin' baby you're gonna be someone else's baby not mine
Squeeze me baby till my face turn cherry red roll me so hard I'm gonna fall right out of bed
Please stop messin' around you're messin around all the time
If you don't stop messin' baby you're gonna be someone else's baby not mine
Yeah
Used to be so easy to give my heart away
But I found out the hard way there's a price you have to pay
I found out that love was no friend of mine
I should have known time after time
So long it was so long ago but I've still got the blues for you
Used to be so easy to fall in love again
But I found out the hard way it's a road that leads to pain
I found that love was more than just a game
You're playin' to win but you lose just the same
So long it was so long ago but I've still got the blues for you
So many years since I've seen your face
Here in my heart there's an empty space where you used to be
So long it was so long ago but I've still got the blues for you
Though the days come and go there is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you
Standin' at the station
Teardrops in my eyes
Standin' at the station
Wonderin' why
You love him more than you love me
You wanna marry him
Make a family
That's why I'm standin' at the station
Teardrops in my eyes
Well I'm standin' at the station
Sad as a man can be
And you're gazing through the window
Waving good-bye to me
Well I know you got to do what you got to do
But you're leaving me
And I'm loving you
That's why I'm standin' at the station
Teardrops in my eyes
Yes I'm standin' at the station
Teardrops in my eyes

Somebody done changed somebody done changed the lock on that door
Somebody done changed they done changed the lock on that door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more
Now I came home last night about half past ten
Tried to get the key in the lock but I couldn't get it in
'Cause somebody done changed
They done changed the lock on that door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more
I looked through the window to see what I could see
She was talking to someone else
I know it wasn't me
She said "daddy daddy daddy daddy you don't have to go
'Cause I done changed I done changed that lock on my door"
She changed the bed around even painted the door
She even changed the carpet I mean on the floor
My baby changed
Oh she done changed the lock on my door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more
Well I walked down the street lookin' where I used to go
She's got a mean black snake and I can't go there no more
My baby changed
She done changed the lock on my door
And the key I got won't fit that lock no more
When I was a young boy
Well they tried to tell me
That I was movin'
Movin' way too fast
And I knew everything
About everything
But I really didn't wanna listen
To a bunch of old folks talkin' trash
So I got out on the highway
Pedal to the floor
Smokin' and drinkin'
And a whole lot more
But when they came to collect me
Out of that jail
They said boy next time
You get no bail
Chorus:
You better slow down
You better slow down
Woke up one mornin'
Ooh to a hunger
I moaned
And I began to twitch
Felt the need
For some lovin'
A little sweet somebody
To scratch my itch
Momma said I don't mean to pry
But I'm here to advise you
Seeds like to grow
When you put 'em in fertilizer
Chorus
Doin' my own thing
I'm all grown up
Yes I am
Little bit older
But I feel like a young buck
I'm ridin' down the highway
In a brand new mini van
Wife and kids screamin'
Ooh God I'm a family man
I'm outta mind
Losin control
I could leave tomorrow
But there ain't nowhere to go
Chorus
Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh
rolling down the eastern sea border
I got my rig so wound up
and she's running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead on my right
but I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Well my rig's a little low
but that don't mean that she's slow
There a flame from her stack
blowing smoke as black as coal
My hotel's comin' in sight
if you think I'm happy all right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
I've got ten forward gears
and a sweet Georgia overdrive
I got the pedal to the metal
and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy in white
I've been passing everything in sight
Six days on the road and I gotta see my baby tonight
The ICC is checking on down the line
I'm a little hung over
And my log book is way behind
but nothing bothers me tonight
Just I can dodge them scales alright
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Yeah it seems like a year since I kissed my baby bye bye
I can have a lot of chicks but I'm not like some other guys
Yes I can find one to hold me tight
but you know it wouldn't be alright
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
I pulled out of Pittsburgh
rolling down the eastern sea border
I got my rig wound up
and she's running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead on my right
but I can dodge the law all night
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I gotta see my baby tonight
I used to wake up in the morning with an aching head
I couldn't remember anything I'd said
My friends told me I was getting out of line
if it wasn't for you baby I'd be doing time
Since I met you baby you've made a new man of me
Since I met you baby I'm happy as a man could be
Yes I am
I used to think I was better than the rest
Ain't no doubt about it I was no second best
Didn't seem to matter what was right or what was wrong
I did some crazy things before you came along
Since I met you baby you've made a new man of me
Since I met you baby I'm happy as a man could be
Yes I am
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
I'm happy as a man could be
One more time
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
Well since I met you baby
I'm happy as a man could be
Yes I am
Happy as a man can be
You tell 'em Gary
Yeah
Tell me anybody do you really give a damn for me
I said tell me anybody do you really give a damn for me
'Cause I just got to tell you 'bout a thing that's botherin' me
I was a ramblin' pony I would roll I would roll I would roll from town to town
I was a ramblin' pony people I would roll from town to town
Yes just looking for a sweet woman and makin' all my love come on down
Yeah
If I needed anybody baby I would take ya home with me
If I need anybody baby I would take ya baby
I would take ya baby I would take ya home with me
But I don't need anybody don't need anybody but him and me
And you're sittin' there so green believe me man I'm just the same as you yeah
Said you're sittin' there so green believe me man I'm just the same as you
Do you want me to make a last cry or be satisfied
That's exactly what I mean to do
Chorus:
Shame shame shame
shame on me for loving you
Shame shame shame
shame on me for loving you
You came and you went
what's this poor boy to do
I tried yes I tried
and you took everything I owned
I tried yes I tried
and you took everything I owned
Oh little girl I wonder
was your love to me just on loan
Shame shame shame
shame on me for loving you
Shame shame shame
shame on me for loving you
You came and you went
what's this poor boy to do
You might be old about years
But you ain't too old to shift them gears
You can shake it up and go Shake it up and go
Shake it up and go Shake it up and go
You good-looking people sure can shake it up and go
Mama killed a chicken she thought it was a duck
She put it on the table with his legs sticking up
She had to shake it up and go Shake it up and go
Shake it up and go Shake it up and go
You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go
I told my baby the week before last
The gait she had was just a little too fast
She had to shake it up and go Shake it up and go
Shake it up and go Shake it up and go
You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go
Look here baby you ain't treating me right
You go out everyday stay out late at night
You got to shake it up and go baby Shake it up and go
You got to shake it up and go Shake it up and go
You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go
Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans
Then you can understand just what I mean
All thru the week it's quiet as a mouse
But on Saturday night they go from house to house
You don't have to pay the usual admission
If you're a cook a waiter or a good musician
So if you happen to be just passin' by
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Now my buddy and me was on the main stem
Foolin' around just me and him
We decided we could use a little something to eat
So we went to a house on Rampart Street
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease
And a lush little Miss said "Come in please"
And before we could even bat an eye
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Now the folks was havin' the time of their life
And Sam was jivin' Jimmie's wife
Over in the corner was a beat up grand
Being played by a big fat piano man
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks
Some of them had on bobbie socks
But everybody was nice and high
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'
The bottles was flyin' and the fish was smellin'
And way above all the noise we made
Somebody hollered "You better get outta here this is a raid"
I didn't know we was breaking the law but
Somebody reached over and hit me on the jaw
Now they had us blocked off from front to back
And they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potatoes in a sack
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
I knew I could get away if I had a chance
But I was shakin' like I had the St Vitus dance
So I tried to crawl in under a bath tab
When a policeman said "Where are you goin' there bub"
Now they got us out of there like a house on fire
And put us all in the black Maria
Now they might have missed a pitiful few
But they got both me and my buddy too
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Well we headed for jail in a dazed condition
They booked each one of us on suspicion
Now my chick came down and paid my bail
And finally got me outta that rotten jail
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye
Just mention a Saturday Night Fish Fry
I don't care how many fish in the sea
But don't ever mention a fish to me
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Spoken:
Take a lot a entertainers sing songs
'Bout the things they experienced in life
Some entertainers sing songs that they-a
seen other people experience in life
Well I'm gonna tell you some of the things

From the little town I ran from
To the city where I strayed
There's been some good time living
And some good music played
And some good loving made
I like it
I like it just that way
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel the beat go on
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel it till it's gone
I wanna roll roll roll forever
And live from song to song
Right there in the music
Is right where I belong
When I meet my Maker
With my music in my hand
He'll smile down when He sees me
And ask about the band
I know He'll understand
He knows life
And life can be so grand
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel the beat go on
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel it till it's gone
I wanna roll roll roll forever
And live from song to song
Right there in the music
Is right where I belong

Oh your homemade lovin' done knocked me out baby
Oh now I've looked long enough for you
And let's see if you know what I'm fixin' to do baby

Takin' it easy moving slow
It's always calm just before the storm you know
Along she came with a brand new season
Since we've been together
There's been a change in the weather
Chorus:
She's a rainmaker
She makes the rain fall from my eyes
She's a rainmaker
She makes a grown man wanna cry
Well I never thought
That a tear could fall
From the eyes of a man
Who never even cried at all
Now I've been happy
I've been blue
For the change in the season
Chorus
The lightning flashes the thunder roars
There's no stoppin' the wind
The tide is washing
Her a path to my door
I've never ever loved like this before
Storm is over the sun is bright
There's a rainbow in my life
Clouds are gone the sky is clear
And since we've been together
There's been a change in the weather
Chorus x
Put your shoe on the other foot you can walk just like me
Put your shoe on another foot you can walk just like me
Walkin' an' a talkin' see an' feel a just like me
Put your hand in another glove you can feel just like me
Put your hand in another glove you can feel a just like me
Walkin' an' a talkin' see an' feel a just like me
Put your shoes on baby
Put your eye on another view you can see just like me
Hey put your eye on another view you can see just like me
Walkin' an' a talkin' see an' feel a just like me
Put your tongue on another word you can talk just like me
Put your tongue on another word you can talk just like me
Walkin' an' a talkin' see an' feel a just like me
Whoa whoa whoa ho
Always talkin' all the time
Whoa whoa whoa ho
Walk on baby
Walkin' an' a talkin' see an' feel a just like me
Whoa whoa whoa ho
You had style you had class
You had everything to make a love last
You had grace you had charm
You had me hanging on your arm
When I found out you were a fake
You rared up and bit me like a snake
And I was ready to let go
And let all my feelings show
Chorus:
Tell me why you wanna be so cold
Why you wanna be so mean
You've gone and let your true colors show
You're a perpetual blues machine
We could have been just fine
If you'd have only been all mine
'Cause I was for real but you did not know
That you were steppin' on my heart
As you were walkin' out the door
But now I know who you are
And it's a damn good thing we didn't get too far
'Cause I'm not the one that's right for you
You need a man to do your rolling
Like what you want him to do
Chorus
Now you've gone and I'm glad
That we didn't let it go too bad
You know I tried to make it go
But there was just no way to tell u so
Chorus
Raise up your hands and put a smile on your face
I'm talking to everyone in the human race
We're proud and strong so stand up tall
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
There's a train of love beginning right here
So jump on to it and have no fear
It's yours it's mine we got the call
Let's all get together and bring peace to the world
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Every man and woman boy and girl
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Shelter the homeless open your door
Feed the hungry give to the poor
Offer your heart don't think small
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Every man and woman boy and girl
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
I was born and raised down in Alabama on a farm way back up in the woods Oh I was so ragged folks used to call me "Patches" Papa used to tease me about it but deep down inside dad was hurtin' 'cause he'd done the best he could
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
Education that he never had
But he did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops we raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life whipped him
Down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
On the day papa called me
To his dyin' bed
Placed his hand on my shoulders
And in tears he said
Patches
I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to you
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
Everyday I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way
We got our meals
See I was the oldest of the family
And everybody was depending on me
Now the years have passed
And everybody's grown
Mama's been livin'
In a brand new home
Lord knows it took
A lot of sweat and tears
And my daddy's voice
To help us through the years
He said:
Patches
I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to you
Daddy had been sick for a long time flat on his back Every evenin' after we'd finish our chores and eat our dinner we'd all go into papa's room to cheer him up a little And this particular day dad was in good spirits sittin' on the side of the bed tellin' mama how good she looked When all of a sudden papa had a pain in his chest I was too young to understand talkin' about a heart attack here Mama rushed us all out of the room into the hallway About ten minutes later she came out with tears in her eyes She called out to me "Patches Patches get in here boy Your daddy wanna see you" I went runnin' into papa's room there papa lay Daddy had tears in his eyes I knew something was wrong daddy was a poor man but all of my life he'd been a proud man I knelt down on one knee beside the bed papa put his hand on my shoulder He said "Patches Patches boy the hammer of life done beat your old papa down to the ground and I ain't got nobody to turn to to take care of mama and the younger So what I want you to do is promise me son is that you're gonna do your best to help your mama as much as you can" I said "Papa I'm gonna do my best" But little did I know then like I know now that tryin' to climb life's mountains searchin' for a top where there ain't no top sometimes you find yourself frustrated lazy But every time I feel like I can't live my life like I want to my mind goes back to that day when I see those tears in my daddy's eyes But most of all I remember his words "Patches I'm dependin' on you boy" Every time I feel like givin' up I hear his voice "Patches Patches Patches Patches -"
I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest
Patches
I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest
Patches
I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to you
You say "Come over baby come talk to me"
Then you drive me so crazy
I can't hardly see
If this keeps goin' on
I might just leave and not come back
I got one foot in your doorway
I got one foot on the path
Well you beg me to stay
then you order me to go
All this up and down
is wear and tear on my soul
I'm wonderin' if our future
is gonna look just like our past
I got one foot in your doorway
I got one foot on the path
Now I love you baby
don't get me wrong
But this heart of mine
may not be that strong
You got me on your line
reel me in or throw me back
I got one foot in your doorway
I got on foot on the path
You'd best thing about it baby
but don't take too long
If we can't get it right
I'll just be movin' on
I can't wait forever
for us to get this thing on track
I got one foot in your doorway baby
I got on foot on the path
I once lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money I didn't care
Always taking my friends out for a good time
Buying champagne gin and wine
But just as soon as my dough got low
I couldn't find a friend no place I go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it and squeeze it
Till the eagle grins
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
In your pocket not one penny
And your friends you haven't any
And as soon as you get on your feet again
Everybody is your long lost friend
It's mighty strange without a doubt but
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
You know folks I once had a mansion
Way up on the side of a hill
I'd give champagne and caviar parties
Just for fun and get a thrill
But you know things they just can't stay like that forever
And now I can't muscle up enough money
To buy a shot of gin
But you know if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it and squeeze it till the eagle grins
It's mighty strange without a doubt
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
I'm shufflin' thru the Texas sand but my head's in Mississippi
I'm shufflin' thru the Texas sand but my head's in Mississippi
The blues has got a hold of me I believe I'm gettin' dizzy
Spoken: Help me now
I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis Lord I thought I was in heaven
I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis I thought I was in heaven
But I was stumblin' thru the parking lot of an invisible seven eleven
Spoken: What was I doin' out there
Where's my head baby
Somewhere in Mississippi
Last night I saw a cowgirl she was floatin' across the ceiling
And last night I saw a naked cowgirl she was floatin' across the ceiling
She was mumblin' to some howlin' wolf about some voodoo
healin'
Spoken: Hmm Baby
If I never get to heaven I don't care
I been down to the crossroads
And there ain't no devil down there
They got the whole town shakin'
Out in LA
They got the blues in Mississippi
I'm going back some day
And I ain't gonna fuss and fight
I ain't stayin' up all night
Worryin' 'bout the things that I can't change
Let everybody think I'm a little bit strange
Chorus:
Cause I love Muddy Water
It's dirty but it feels alright
I love Muddy Waters
I'm ready for the blues tonight-ooh yes I am
On my way to California
My old car broke down
I left it sittin' right there
And I walked on into town
I found a cheap hotel
Got a twenty dollar room
And when I woke up the next day
It was four o'clock in the afternoon
Well I ain't gonna fuss and fight
I ain't stayin' up all night
Worryin' 'bout the things that I can't change
Let everybody think I'm a little bit strange
Chorus
Ooh why should I worry all night and day
Whatever it is
It's gonna be ok
Chorus
Da-da uh
Mr Collins
Girls please
Mr Collins Mr Collins
Please Mr Collins
Don't play so loud Mr Collins
What
What'd you say
Mr Collins
Mr Collins Mr Collins
Please Mr Collins
Don't play that loud Mr Collins
Hey
Hey
Hey
Mr Collins
Mr Collins Mr Collins
Please Mr Collins
Hey Mr Collins
Hey
Hey
Daddy came around every once in awhile
But momma she was there all the time
And summertime in Compton
Was not like TV
But we were right there
Where we needed to be
And the Thurmond boys
On peach street
With only their dad
So proud of themselves
And that old Pontiac they had
And miss brooks her bible
And her three little boys
At the double rock
Baptist church
Makin' a joyful noise
Chorus:
Well there's more than
One way home
Ain't no right way
Ain't no wrong
And whatever road you
Might be on
You find your own way
'Cause there's more than
One way home
Got me a job at the grocery store
Workin' weekdays after
School from to
Tommy John and Charlie were
The neighborhood stars
With their midsize homes
And their big fancy cars
And when the eagle flied on Friday
I'd go out and play
Wastin' time with Otis
Out on the dock of the bay
And my ticket to adventure
Was a ride on the bus
Different places
Different faces
But they were just like us
Chorus x
When I first met you baby I didn't even know your name
When I first met you baby I didn't even know your name
Oh I was feelin' low on the ground bad luck and evil women were to blame
I never realized how sweet and kind one woman can be
I never realized people how sweet and kind a woman can be
Oh but when I looked in your eyes I knew true love had come to me
Yeah
Take my hand hold it tight and don't let go
Take my hand take my hand hold it tight and don't let go
'Cause our love is like a merry-go-round forever and ever round it
goes
Merry Christmas baby
Babe you sure did treat me nice
Yeah Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby
Babe you sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
And now I'm living in paradise
Oh I'm feeling mighty fine this morning
I've got good music on my radio
Hey baby I'm feeling mighty fine
I've got good music on my radio
I would love to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe
Santa came down the chimney
About half past three
He got all of these presents that you'll use
See I'll help you put on these
Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby
Oh You sure been good to me
I haven't had a drink this evenin' baby
But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree
Hey Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby
I've got good music on my radio
I said Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby
I've got good music on my radio
I would love to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe
This is a mean ole' world
Baby to live in all by yourself
I said a mean mean mean ole' world
To live in all by yourself
When you can't get the woman you're loving
Because she's loving somebody else
I smile to keep from worrying
And I laugh just to keep from crying
Smile to keep from worrying
Laugh just to keep from crying
Trying to keep the public from knowing
Baby what I've got on my mind
Someday baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
Someday baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
You won't be able to mistreat me no more then baby
'Cause my heart won't feel no pain
You're throwing it all away
Everything we've been living for
All the promises that were made
They all have gone and flown away
You locked me out
And let your new love come in
Now you are making it
With my closest friend
Fussing and fighting baby
Where have you been
Yeah I get the message
That you clearly send
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
I saw you at the place
Where we used to go
Showing it off
With the lights down low
Telling your lover about eternity
How soon you forget
That's what you once told me
Your sweet talking
Made me go for it
Now you've got someone else
At the top of your list
Like the wind
That's blowing free
Suddenly you've changed
Turned your back on me
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
Your sweet talking
Made me go for it
Now you've got someone else
At the top of your list
Like the wind
That's blowing free
Suddenly you've changed
Turned your back on me
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
You're so mean and evil
You're so mean
Well now now darlin' may a have a little talk with you
Well now now now now darlin may a have a little talk with you
Because it won't be long before our true love will be through
Well now now now darlin' am I right or am I wrong
Yeah now now now darlin' am I right or am I wrong
Because it won't be long before our true love will be through
You know I like my coffee sweet in the morning

Ooh ooh oooh
Went to a party on Saturday night
Lookin real cool and dressed just right
Saved my money every week
Just could not spend it on those fine chicks
Got Gotta my car and walked in the door
You know just what I was lookin' for
Look at that blonde in the redskin tights
Don't go with her she's the one that bites
A fine fine thing in a short short skirt
She ain't attached and she likes to flirt
A whole lotta woman is where it's at
Hey now boys will you just look at that
I don't know which way to turn
Every way I look my eyeballs burn
Short gals tall gals skinny and fat
Look at that look at that look at that look at that
See them twins in fishnet hose
I'll take either one or both of those
Sally over there still long and lean
She's got the key to my lovin' machine
All these girls are lookin' just right
At a hip-shakin' party on a Saturday night
Look over here look over there
Look all around me everywhere
Well it doesn't really matter
which way I wanna go
'Cause the night is a fallin'
and I'm a long long way from home
I am a long long way from home yes I am
Listen to this listen to that
people tryin' to tell me
Where it's at
but it really doesn't matter
I hear it all the time
and I'm standing at the crossroads
'Bout to move on down the line
about to move on down the line
Well I've been over here been over there
Friends all around me everywhere
but it really doesn't matter
Which way I wanna go
I'm a million miles from nowhere
And that's a long long way from home
And that's a long long way from home
Yeah a million miles from nowhere
And that's a long long way from home
And that's a long long way from home
Locomotive rollin' by
Locomotive see you rollin' by
Well your smoke is black blackest I've ever seen
And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean
Locomotive well your fuel is hot
Locomotive well your fuel is hot
I hear you comin' hear you coming but you're not
Oh your engine's so loud then you come to a stop
Locomotive now you try so hard

Oh right along don't stop dead in your tracks

Locomotive rollin' by

Well your smoke is black blackest I've ever seen
And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean
And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean
Locomotive now you try so hard

You've got to keep on moving keep on moving right along
Oh right along don't stop dead in your tracks
I can't go on with this song no more no more
Well now sittin' here so lonely feelin' oh so blue
My baby's tryin' to mistreat me and I don't know what to do
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah I've loved her for such a long time to end it all this way
Sittin' here so lonely tears keep fallin' just like rain
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah you know I love you baby I'll do anything for you
But when we start to fightin' I just get these same old blues
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah now when I first met you baby at a dance and we did fine
Now we're together and it's a total waste of time
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Well I guess it's just my own fault the truth I cannot hide
But if I ever get her back again I'll stay right by her side
I won't be cryin' I'll stay happy that a way
I'll be lovin' my little baby every night and every day
You stay out all night 'til the break of day
Snap me up with everything I say
Little by little oh I'm losin' you I can see
And bit by bit darlin' your love is slippin' away from me
Oh what you're doin' baby don't you know it ain't right
I wonder what your doin' that it takes all night
Little by little oh I'm losin' you I can see
And bit by bit your love is slippin' away from me
Now I say ooh
Oh now ooh I say ooh
Oh I get so disgusted when I try to kiss you
Just don't feel like it used to do
Little by little oh I'm losing you I can see oh oh oh
And bit by bit darlin' your love is slippin' away from me
Oooh now I drove to last night in my car
So scared I might find just what I was looking for
Little by little oh I'm losin' you I can see
And bit by bit your love is slippin' away from me
Now I say ooh baby that's the way I feel
Oh I say ooh child oh that's the way that I feel
I said ooh child baby that's the honey that's the
Oooh lordI say ooh child baby that's the way I feel
Oh I say ooh child baby that's the way I feel
I said oohh child baby that's the way I feel
Ooooh child

Hello there my old friend
not so long ago it was 'till the end
We played outside in the pouring rain
on our way up the road we started over again
You're livin' a dream wo you on top
My mind is achin' Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop
Up and down that road in our worn out shoes
talkin' 'bout good things and signin' the blues
You went your way I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time
You're livin' a dream wo you on top
My mind is achin' Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop
No wasted time we're alive today
Churnin' up the past there's no easier way
Time's been between us a means to an end
God it's good to be here walkin' together my friend
You're livin' a dream wo you on top
My mind is achin' Lord it won't stop

Hello my old friend
It's been awhile
All our old clothes
Are back in style
We went our separate ways
Only to return
To face a lesson
We failed to learn
We didn't understand the truth
We were blinded by the eyes of youth
But time kept on moving
And a change has come
You think that I don't know
Where you're coming from
Chorus:
'Cause I feel just like you
And I cry just like you
But I heal just like you
And under my skin
I'm just like you
You gave your love and your innocence
And they took away your confidence
Well I'm not those women
I'm not those men
Put your arms around me
I am your friend
Chorus
Bridge:
You and everybody else
When I get hurt
I cry for help
And I've got secrets
That god only knows
And god knows I feel
Chorus
When you've got no more assurance
Than a great big hunk of lead
If you don't respond to romance
Jack you're dead
When a chick is smiling at you
Even though there's nothing said
If you stand there like a statue
Jack you're dead
You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man Mose
When you get no kicks from loving
And you blow your top instead
It's a fact that you ain't living
Jack you're dead
If you just ain't got nobody
Since you've gone and lost your head
Rigor Mortis has set in daddy
Jack you're dead
What's the use of having muscles
When your life hangs by a thread
If you ain't got no red corpuscles
Jack you're dead
You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man Mose
When you get no kicks from loving
And the news begins to spread
All the cats will holler "Murder"
Jack you're dead
All the breaths leaked out of you
When your friends gather round the bed
And look at you and say "Um um um don't he look natural"
When that happens to you daddy
Jack you're dead
I'm gonna tell you just the way I feel
No use in waiting around
I've got this feeling that it might be real
and that's just from the sound
Oh my heart when I heard you laugh
and when I saw that smile
You made me feel like I was alive again
I hadn't felt that in a while
But I don't want to waste your time
'Cause if I'm not the right girl or
it's not the right time for you
Here's what I'm gonna do
I'll send this song out to you
Oh then it's up to you
Now don't you worry that you'll break my heart
Don't make no difference to me
I've had it happen once or twice before
Won't need no sympathy
I'll probably find something to keep my mind very occupied
I think I'll read some book on my list
or take a long walk outside
But I don't want to waste your time
'Cause if I'm not the right girl or
it's not the right time for you
Here's what I'm gonna do
I'll send this song out to you
Oh then it's up to you
Oh it's up to you baby it's up to you baby
Oh it's up to you baby it's up to you baby
And while I don't want to waste your time
I just ask that you maybe play it out in your mind
And if your heart starts talking to you
Just hear what it's saying 'cause
It might be telling you what to do
Oh it's up to you baby it's up to you baby
Oh it's up to you baby it's up to you baby
It's a great great pleasure a great great great big thrill
It's a great great pleasure a great great great big thrill
When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill
Did you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones
Do you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones
Do you get a funny feelin' running up and down your bones
That's arthritis
It's a great great pleasure a great great great big thrill
It's a great great pleasure a great great great big thrill
When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand
Find you ain't got a nickel and your woman got another man
Bad deal
I miss the arms that used to hold me
The tender way we used to kiss
I miss the way that you touch me
I miss the sweet taste of your lips
I was a fool to ever leave you
You were a fool to let me go
Oh it's so lonesome lonesome here with out you
Oh how I miss you so
It hurt it hurt it hurt so bad
You were the best man I ever had
Why was I so blind to see
Now the biggest fool is me

The tender way we used to kiss
Ooo yes ooo I miss the way that you touch me
I miss the sweet taste of your lips
It hurt it hurt it hurt so bad
'Cause ooh you were the best man I ever ever ever had
Why was I so blind to see
And now the biggest fool is me
Oh Oh what a fool I was darlin' yes
And oh you were a fool to let let me go why did you let me go

Oh how I miss you so

Ohohohooooo Lord now
Oh I miss you baby
You said you were hurting
You almost lost your mind
'Cause the girl you love she hurts you all the time
When things go wrong go wrong with you
It hurts me too
You love her more when you should love her less
Why do you pick up behind her
and I know you pick up all her mess
When things go wrong go wrong with you
It hurts me too
Oh so you better leave that girl
Oh you better put her down
'Cause the girl you love
She hurts you all the time
When things go wrong go wrong with you
It hurts me too
Now she loves another man and boy I love you
But oh I know that you love her
I always see you stick to her like glue
When things go wrong go wrong with you
It hurts me too
Oh so you better leave that girl
Oh you better put her down
'Cause the girl you love
She hurts you all the time
When things go wrong go wrong with you
It hurts me too
It had to be you
It had to be you
I've wandered around
Finally found
Somebody who
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue
And even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinking of you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Try to be boss
They wouldn't do
For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
'Cause nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Had to be you
Had to be you
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
Had to be you
Wonderful you yeah
I gotta a girl who's always late
Anytime we have a date
But I love her
Yes I love her
I'm gonna walk up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her
Is you is or is you ain't my baby
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
You is still my baby baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one you find
She's gone and made a change
Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
If you love me
You will give your heart
Why should be apart
If you love me
If you love me
You will know the truth
I wasn't born to lose
And I love you
Affinity and communication
That makes reality
Understanding is the first thing
It means so much to me
If I love you
I will find the key
If it's meant to be
'Cause I love you
Affinity and communication
That makes reality
Understanding is the first thing
It means so much to me
If I love you
I will find the key
If it's meant to be
'Cause I love you
If you love me like you say
Why you treat me like you do
If you love me like you say baby
Why you treat me like you do
Well I ain't no fool

Why you treat me like ya do
If you love me like ya say baby
Why you treat me like ya do
Well I ain't no fool

If trouble was money I'd swear I'd be a millionaire

Worry worry worry worry babe I had worries on my mind yeah

My mother used to tell me she said "Son there gonna be days gonna be days like this"
My mother used to tell me she said "Son there gonna be days it's gonna be days be days like this"
She said "I always want you to be a winner" she said "Son I don't

Hey you're the greatest thing in my life baby
Oh without your love baby I don't know just what I'll do
Oh years of loving you you've been so true
I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you
Oh I guess I've been lucky to have someone so dear
To talk and laugh and always bring me cheer
Oh after all of this years you've been so true to me baby
I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you
Oh after all the lies I've told you
Just like givin' you givin' you the stars
Oh buying you mink coats mink coats and diamonds
Money in the bank and each year each year two brand new cars
Hey you've the greatest thing in my life baby
Oh between me and you I've know I got the best deal
Oh let me thank you thank you baby
You've been so true I'd lose my mind if I lost you
I'm your iceman baby ain't here to cool you down
Yes I'm your iceman ladies you'll always know when I'm around
I left Leona Texas to heat this coolest place in town
Gonna play this old guitar mix up some fire with my ice
Yes I'm gonna play this old guitar light your fire with my ice
Sometimes it sounds so good to me I just might play it twice
I'm your iceman baby call me Al if you please
I'm your iceman baby I'm so hot I'll probably freeze
I'm gonna whip up a twister turn tornados to a breeze
Yes I'm your iceman baby
Yes I'm your iceman people fixin' fire with my ice
I'm your iceman ladies I make it hot an' chill it right
If you follow my instructions my ice will last all night
Wait a minute baby
Don't leave just yet
I can explain baby
But it looks like the more I talk
The madder you get
It's not what you think it is
Trust me I wouldn't do you no harm
She means nothing to me
The whole time I was imagining
It was you in my arms
You in my arms
Chorus:
I was wrong
And I admit it
My explanations
Don't seem to get it
I was wrong
And my heart can't take it
If you leave me now
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not gonna make it-no
What about the good times baby
What about all the fun we had together
It meant a lot to me baby
It must have meant something to you
Well ok I see your point
But baby please
Don't let a little thing like this come between us
Cause our love is bigger than this
It's more than this
It's bigger than the universe
It's bigger than life
Chorus x
All of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
I've said all of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
Hey I've got a new story to tell you this evening baby
One that ain't never been told
I went to work the other day
But I thought that I would double back
And that car I saw sitting in front of my door
Looked like a brand new a brand new Cadillac yeah
I ain't got none now baby
I think you've been cheating on me
I believe to my soul baby that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need
The iceman came by this morning
And you know he didn't leave no ice
The postman came by later baby
And he didn't even ring twice
I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need
Now I want you to tell the iceman
The next time he'd better leave some ice
And I want you to tell the postman
He'd better ring more than twice
And when I come home from work in the morning
Better still be some groceries on the shelf
I want to tell that slick insurance man
That he'd better write some insurance on his self
Yes I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby that you've given me some help some help
Some help I don't really need
I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh I pity the fool
Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Look at the people

Look they're just standing there

Watching you make a fool of me
So much has went unspoken
Along the way
Hearts have healed
And hearts have broken
In the pain of yesterday
Gone are the shadows
They vanished in the Light
Let your heart surrender
Let your soul take flight
Chorus:
And let bygones be bygones
And troubles be long gone
And if I never told you
How I feel about you
I'm telling you now
We gather here together
With all of our friends
In a room full of love and laughter
The healing begins
And if this was my last moment
My last breath
I'd wanna be surrounded
With joy and happiness
Chorus
And if I never told you
How I feel about you
I'm telling you now
I've been a roaming Romeo
My Juliets have been many
But now my roaming days are gone
Too many irons in the fire
Is worse than not having any
I've had my share and from now on
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I got on you
I'm giving all my love to one baby
Lord help me
If my baby don't come through
I've got a great big amount
Saved up in my love account
Honey and I decided
Love divided in two won't do
So I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I got on you
Now here's what I mean
I've been a roaming Juliet
Yeah she has
My Romeos have been many
You're right baby
But now my roaming days are gone
That's what I wanna hear
Too many irons in the fire
Yeah
Is worse than not having any
Um huh
I've had my share and from now on
Yeah
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I got on you
Daddy
I'm giving all my love to one baby
Lord help me
If my baby don't come through
Got a great big amount
Saved up in my love account
Honey I've decided
Love divided in two won't do
In two won't do
So I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I got on you
I'm betting everything I got on you
I'm betting on you baby
Got on you
I'm betting on you
Get with me baby
I'm on your side
Get with me baby
I'm on your side
Well there's a change
In the weather
Change of time
But I'm a stubborn man
I won't change my mind
Get with me baby
I'm on your side
Talk to me baby
I'm on your side
Talk with me baby

And let me make it alright
Get with me baby

Ill be your sugar daddy

If that's what you need baby
What I need to be girl
Get with me baby

Now I don't wanna own you
Like a private property
Come on baby

Get with me baby

Get with me baby
I'm on your side
Just this morning
I took a big long look around
I've lived it up and loved it up
And done it in this town
Life goes on
Look like it's time
For moving on
Good-bye baby
I wanna thank you for the ride
We did a dance and took a chance
Nothing we ain't tried
C'est la vie
Time you and me
Moving on
I'm moving on
I'll see you somewhere down the line
I'm moving on
We're looking good and feeling fine
I'm moving on
And you are yours and I'm mine
I'll see you somewhere in my dreams
I'm moving on
So thanks for all the memories
I'm moving on
And you can call me Mr Breeze
I'm moving on
Life is full of mysteries
Nothing is ever what it seems
Might try Vegas
And keep on playing till I win
Or take it out to Hollywood
And fall in love again
Come what may
Night and day
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'll see you somewhere down the line
I'm moving on
We're looking good and feeling fine
I'm moving on
And you are yours and I'm mine
I'll see you somewhere in my dreams
I'm moving on
So thanks for all the memories
I'm moving on
And you can call me Mr Breeze
I'm moving on
Life is full of mysteries
Nothing is ever what it seems
I've been around the world seen everything
And if it's love you want baby just give me a ring
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
I've loved in sunshine I've loved in the rain
All of the women who know me call that loving man
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
Some people go to school to try and learn their trade
Yes but I'm a lover a lover by nature
That's why I know I know I know I've got it made
Yes you might think I'm jokin' or just havin' fun
But they tell me the reason I'm the king
I'm a lovin' son of a gun
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
I'm gonna move baby way out on the outskirts of town
I'm gonna move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody who's always hanging around
I'm gonna tell you baby we're gonna move away from here
I don't want no ice man I'm gonna get me a frigidaire
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody who's always hanging around
I'm gonna bring my own groceries gonna bring them everyday
That'll stop the grocery boy and keep him away
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't need nobody always hanging around
It may seem funny honey as funny as funny can be
But if we have any children I want them all to look like me
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody always hanging around
I'm beginnin' to wonder baby what's goin' on when I'm not at home
I'm beginnin' to wonder baby I know you ain't there all alone
Ev'ry time I have to leave you woman I wonder who's takin' my place an' turnin' you on
I'm beginnin' to wonder woman why I worry ev'ryday
I said I'm beginnin' to wonder woman wonder why I feel this way
I be home early Tuesday evenin' better hide your part-time man away
I'm beginnin' to wonder woman why we're wasting all this time
I'm beginnin' to wonder baby wonder why we didn't see the signs
What we did we've never forgotten what we had we left behind
My baby's gone and left me cryin' by myself
My baby's gone and left me cryin' by myself
I loved another woman now I lost my best gal
She was a real good woman never done me no harm
Was a real good woman never done me no harm
I loved another woman now she's up and she's gone
Well come back baby I won't do you no wrong
Come back baby I won't do you no wrong
I loved another woman and I won't do that no more
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Repeat to end
Oh my darling I was so lonely
Searching for you and for you only
Oh my darling I love you so
Oh my darling my love is true
Longing for you no one else will do
Oh my darling I love you so
When I first saw you dear I knew you were alone

Until he started playing those wedding bells

And best of all I know now
That I'll never have to be blue

I think I'm gonna have to move people
I gotta move out of my neighborhood
Hey I said I'm gonna have to move
I gotta get out of my neighborhood
Because you see
The women they tell lies on me
And the men they just don't mean me
No doggone good
Every time my telephone rings
Some lady trying to play
Some old funny game on me
Every time my telephone rings
Some lady trying to play
Some old funny game on me
And every time my front doorbell rings
Some angry six foot man
With a knife in his hand
They say I'm in love with a woman
That works down at the Chicken Shack
They say Deacon Jones' wife
Gave me a brand new Cadillac
That's why I gotta move
I gotta get out of my neighborhood
I tell you the people
They tell lies on me
Hey they just don't mean me
No doggone good
My landlady came by my apartment
She came by just to make up my bed
But it took her all night long
Can you imagine what the neighbors said
That's why I gotta move
Hey I gotta get out
Of my neighborhood
I tell you the people
They tell lies on me
Hey they just don't mean me
No doggone good
Hey I gotta move
Hey I gotta move
I gotta move
I gotta move
Hey the people the people
Don't like me here people
Oh you know they just don't mean me
No doggone good
Nobody loves me but my mother
Sometimes I think
She could be jiving too
Hey nobody
Nobody loves me but my mother
And she could be jiving too
Now I think you know
Why I act funny baby
Oh when you do the things you do
I don't want nobody telling me what to do
I don't want nobody telling me what to do
Oh I'm gonna leave you darlin' 'cause I'm just as grown as you
I don't want nobody telling me this and that
I don't want nobody telling me this and that
Oh I'm gonna leave you darling 'cause I don't go for that
You drink your whiskey I'll drink my wine
You tend to your business and I'll tend to mine
I don't want nobody telling me how to live my life
Oh I'm gonna leave you darling just don't want to be your wife
Well you used to boss your girl that I won't deny
Before I let you boss me I'm gonna lay down and die
I don't want nobody telling me what to do
I don't want nobody telling me what to do
Oh I'm gonna leave you darlin' 'cause I'm just as grown as you
You tell me that you love me
That you really care
We've talked it out
We did our best
And still it ain't going nowhere
It feels like our forever
just ended yesterday
And all our tomorrow's
Were simply tossed away
Should I stay should I go I don't know
Could it be I've always
Known it all along
And didn't have the courage
To tell you what was wrong
What's the in cryin
Why should we be sad
Maybe in the long run
It really ain't so sad
Should I stay should I go I don't know
Whatever I tell myself
Whatever I do
I can't get a hold on nothing
And I can't break through
Whenever I feel myself
Slipping away
I'm gonna hold on
There's a time to walk away
And a time to learn
A time will come when Ill know
Just when and where to turn
Until we know the answer
Faith is all we have
Our trust is in the moment
Fear is in the past
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
Still makes me so blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you
I've made up my mind
To live in memories
All the lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy happy hours baby
That we once knew
Though long ago
It still makes me blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you baby

To live in memories
All the lonesome time
I can't stop loving you

You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more
You told me you were high class but I can see through that
You told me you were high class but I can see through that
And daddy I know you ain't no real cool cat
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog been snooping round my door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog been snooping round my door
You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more
You made me feel so blue you made me weep and moan

You ain't looking for a woman Lord knows what you're looking for
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog been snooping round my door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog been snooping round my door
You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more
Remember if you can
When cotton was picked by hand
Down in Dixie
Under southern skies
Working from sun to sun
Remember if you will
Lightnin' from a whiskey still
Blues in the breeze
The sweet magnolia trees
A little church house up on the hill
Chorus:
I can hear the delta calling
From the light of a distant star
I can see my future
And I can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar
Won't you take me back in time
Free me from this crime
Well I have no shame
And I have no blame
It's time for us to be moving on
I can hear the delta calling
From the light of a distant star
I can see my future
And I can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar
Chorus x
I can hear the delta calling
From the light of a distant star

Can't you see when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me crazy
Something inside of me when she's gone I miss her so
I wanna tell her how I feel just gotta let her know
When I'm alone with her and she's in my arms I'm in heaven
It's all I see in my dreams we'll be happy together
Side by side I hope that our love will stay this way forever
Something inside of me got a feelin' that won't let go
I wanna tell her how I feel I just gotta let her know
Lookin' through her eyes I see a paradise no mistake she's full of fire
Like a real live wire a house on fire
She's my burnin' she's my burnin' burnin' desire
Well it's hard to be it's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby

Feeling low
Got no money
Got nowhere to go
Hand it over

Chorus:
Hand it over

Give it up give it over

Ill heal your body
And feed your soul
If the road is dark
And you can`t find your way
Just let the spirit light the way
Hand it over
Get on your knees and pray

Chorus
Say things to me like a cowgirl would
I'll do tricks for you like a cowboy should
You look romantic layin' in the hay
I need you tonight in a new kind-a way
When you look at me with those eyes
it makes me start to fantasize
Do it to me like I know you could
so I can do it to you baby like a Texan should
Ridin' the range I think of you
I dig your chili you know it's true
Make big money put it in the bank
that longhorn caddy got a great big tank
Do it to me like I know you could
so I can do it to you baby like a Texan should
Well you're the kind-a woman who's above the rest
well nothing for me but the best
You say you need a fella who really can
do it to you good like a Texan man
Massive wardrobe of cowboy clothes
top of my head to the tip of my toes
Ah you look so good in my hat with fringe on it
so put on my boots hmmm doggone it
Do it to me like I know you could
I do it to you like a Texan should
Do it to me baby like I know you could
so I can do it to you baby like a good Texan should
I'm gonna write him a letter gonna write him a song
Gonna love my baby gonna never do him wrong
Gonna love my baby gonna ease his troubled mind
I'm gonna love that man until the end of time
I said now if the end of time should come today
I said there's just no way that I can stay away
'Cause he's my baby wanna ease his troubled mind
I'm gonna love that man until the sun don't shine
I said now if that sun should refuse to shine
I'm gonna find my baby 'cause he's mine all mine
I'm gonna find my baby gonna ease his troubled mind
I'm gonna find that man 'cause he's mine all mine
Now just the other day I heard somebody say that my man
was running around with another woman
Now this better not be true because if it is
It's not gonna be a good thing
He's gonna have to run and I'm gonna tell you right now
what I'm gonna do with that man I'll tell you right now
I said now if that man should run he better hide
I'm gonna find that man I'm gonna take him for a ride
I'm gonna find my baby gonna give that man a troubled mind
I'm gonna find that man and he won't get away alive
I'm gonna find that man and he won't get away alive
Well you might be saved
You might be reborn
You might own a car
With a big loud horn
Maybe it's just news
On your television
Or it might be God trying to get your attention
Are you an engineer
Working on a farm
Or a Casanova
With a whole lotta charme
It might be a mouse
Living in your kitchen
Or it might be God trying to get your attention
Well it might sound bad
Or it might sound good
Might be made of steel
Or it might be made of wood
Maybe it's just news
On your television
Or it might be God trying to get your attention

Or it might be on the street
Somehow or another

Or you might be blind
She'll put the message
Right in your mind
Might look like a plan
Or a coalition
Or it might be God trying to get your attention
Well you might be deaf
Or you might be dumb
You'll get the answer
When the answer comes
Maybe it's just news on your television
Or it might be God trying to get your attention
It might be God trying to get your attention
You got to give a little
Take a little
And let your poor heart
Break a little

You've got to laugh a little
Cry a little
Until the clouds
Roll by a little

That's the glory of love
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world
And all its charms
But when the world
Is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little
Lose a little
And always have
The blues a little
That's the story of
That's the glory of love

I was a rebel from the day I left school
grew my hair long and broke all the rules
I'd sit and listen to my records all day
with big ambitions of where I could play
My parents taught me what life was about
so I grew up the type they warned me about
They said my friends were just an unruly mob
and I should get a haircut and get a real job
Get a haircut and get a real job
clean your act up and don't be a slob
Get it together like your big brother bob
why don't you get a haircut and get a real job
I even tried that to scene
I told myself that it was all a bad dream
I found a band and some good songs to play
and now I party all night I sleep all day
I met this chick she was my No fan
she took me home to meet her mommy and dad
They took one look at me and said "Oh my god"
get a haircut and get a real job
Get a real job why don't you get a real job
Get a real job why don't you get a real job
I hit the big time with my rock 'n' roll band
the future's brighter now than I'd ever planned
I'm ten times richer than my big brother bob
and he he's got a haircut he's got a real job
Why don't you get a haircut and get a real job
I even tried that to scene
Further on up the road someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road just you wait and see

Just past Friar's Point all the way across those lanes
Just past Friar's Point all the way across those lanes
I was walking by the cotton fields and I swear I heard Robert Johnson play
Down in New Orleans preaching in the Lion's Den
Down in New Orleans preaching in the Lion's Den
You can hear Irma Thomas take you right back to church again
We got the blues now surely ain't got a thing to lose
Oh we got the blues surely don't have a thing to lose
Oh darling it's them blues that really make them move
Oh do they hang on Beale Street music blasting out of every door
Oh do they hang on Beale Street music pouring out of every pore
Rocking the house at BB's your feet they never touch the floor
Oh south side of Chicago oh all the way where Magic Sam used to play
Oh south side of Chicago over at the Checkerboard Lounge
You can still hear Muddy Waters playing that song "Slow Down"
Oh we got the blues time sure don't have a thing to lose
Oh we got the blues time surely don't have a thing to lose
And these are the people all ready to make a move
Don't understand
How I could be so blind
Something is changing
And I don't know why
Heaven knows how much I sacrifice
I hear you I hear you
Now nothing in this world
Will ever change her mind
Freedom what she needs
She wants freedom
'Cause she got dreams
In her heart it's time to go
A long way from home
Yes it's a long way from home
I still remember
Her standing there
Yeah baby
The sun was shining
On her soft brown hair
Well all my life
Every tear I cried
I saw the future in her eyes
Now her heart says it's time to go
A long way from home
Freedom is what she needs
She wants freedom
'Cause she's got dreams
And I hope she knows she's not alone
'Cause it's a long way from home
It's a long way from home
I think about her and then I pray
That she'll be safe and warm
Safe and warm
I get on my knees
Down on my knees
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Freedom is what she needs
She wants freedom
'Cause she's got dreams
Give her freedom to believe
Her heart says it's time to go
A long way from home
Such a long way from home
It's a long way from home
Freedom
Uh huh that's what I want
Freedom
That's what I need
Freedom
That's what I've got to have
Freedom
Oh baby that's what I've gotta have
Freedom
Oh baby baby
Freedom
Freedom freedom
She needs freedom
Freedom
That's what she needs
She wants she wants freedom
Freedom she wants freedom
She's got to have
Freedom she wants freedom
Tired of being alone
Waiting on you to phone baby
It's four in the morning and I'm cold
There ain't no one to hold me
I know that's it's real
I found someone new
I know it's not right
But I can't give up this fight
'Cause I'm tired of being lonely
Think it's me that's been wrong
I know I love you today
Oh but I don't love you in that way
Trying to make a new start
'Cause your running with my heart
I know that it's real
I found someone new
I know it's not right
But I won't give up this fight
I know that it's true
I found someone new
I know it's not right
But I won't give up I won't I won't I won't
I won't give up this fight
I know that it's true
I found someone new
And I'm tired of being lonely
Think it's me that's been wrong
Darling I'm the only one who's strong
I've been strong
When I was a young man
Just gotten out
I didn't know
What this world was all about
I was lied to I was cheated
I played all kinds of fools
It didn't take me long
To learn the rules
Fool me once shame on you
Fool me twice shame on me
Fool me once shame on you
Fool me twice shame on me
Lady swore she loved me
Loved through and through
And then my pal said
She said she loved him too
And the milkman and the postman
And in a dream
I saw her with the local
Football team
Fool me once shame on you
Fool me twice shame on me
Fool me once
Do me as bad as you can do
Shame on you
Shame on you
Fool me twice
I'll be as mad as I can be
Shame on me
Shame on me
Banker took my money
Bought him a stake
The banker swore that one day
We'd both feel great
Then the 's turned to the 's
And my money can't be found
Banker's on a long trip
Out of town
Fool me once
Do me as bad as you can do
Shame on you
Shame on you
Fool me twice
I'll be as mad as I can be
Shame on me
Shame on me
Ain't got no money
No where to sleep
No friend no family
No bread no meat
No bread no meat
No friend no family
No bread no bread no meat
I ain't got no reason
Ain't got no rhyme
Ain't gettin' no younger
And I'm runnin' outta time
Runnin' outta time
Ain't gettin' no younger
And I'm runnin' outta time
Oh yes I am
Chorus:
But I'm still climbing up the mountain side
Don't count me out
Long as I got my heart and soul
I got everything
I got everything I need
Everything I need
Ain't got no window
Ain't got no door
But I can feel the sun shining
Where it's never shined before
Never shined before
Feel the sun shining where it's never shined before
Chorus x
But I'm still climbing up the mountain side
Can't count me out
Long as I got my heart and soul

Hear me when I call

Everyone has had the blues at some time
And been used I ain't lying
I've been used and abused
And I've got the blues blues blues
Over you
Everyone has had it hard at some time
People trying to find a peace of mind
I've been trying I ain't lying
Trying to find a peace of mind
Over you
I lay every night
Thinking about my situation
I get the blues
Right off the bat
If we can just have
A decent conversation
You know that things
Wouldn't be so bad
Oh I was cheated why I don't know
And mistreated by a no good so and so
I've been cheated and mistreated
And I've got the blues blues blues
Over you
I lay every night
Thinking about my situation
I get the blues
Right off the bat
If we can just have
A decent conversation
You know that things
Wouldn't be so bad
You've got to live and let live
When we were together
All you wanted for me was to give
Now I'm not giving you're barely living
You're on your own
You're living all alone
Now we're through me and you
And I don't have the blues blues blues
Over you
It don't matter if you're rich
It don't make no difference if you're poor
Simple things in life can make you mad to the core
It doesn't matter if you're young
Don't make no difference if you're old
You got to stand a little rain
Before you reach a pot of gold
Chorus:
Everybody gets the blues
Everybody got to cry
Take the good with the bad
Take the lows and the high
Well you work and you worry
Spend you life paying dues

Than it is for a man
Everybody goes dancing
Everybody pays the band
Everybody got to take

Everybody got to live

Take the lows and the high
Well you work and you worry
Spend you life paying dues
Everybody has a hard time sometime
Everybody gets the blues
It's early in the morning and I can't get right
'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night
Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more
And it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I went to her girlfriend's house but she was out
I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout
"Get away from here"
Too early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me she said "B you sure look beat"
It's early in the morning baby
Early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
Had a lot of money when I first started out
I couldn't find my baby now my money's run out
Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
It's early in the morning
I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I ain't never missed a woman anytime or anyhow
Said I ain't never missed a woman anytime or anyhow
I said I ain't never missed nobody just like the way I miss my baby now
If you could see my woman you'd know why no one else can take her place
If you could see my woman people you'd realize why no one else can take her place
You'd know just what I'm talking 'bout if you could see my baby's sweet sweet face
That's why I ain't never missed a woman anytime or any place
No I ain't never ever missed a woman anytime or any place
When I say I ain't never missed nobody I mean I ain't never missed
nobody like I miss my baby now yeah
You've been runnin' in the streets again but I'd never had a hand on you
I've been a better man this year than all the men that you've been through
Don't mistake kindness for weakness 'cause a little girl only a fool would stay with you
I tried so hard to please you babe I've even turned your lies to truth
I said I tried so hard to please you baby I turned your lies to truth
But when you said were my baby I think I got to ask you for more proof
Don't mistake kindness for weakness 'cause your chicken has come to roost
I said don't mistake kindness for weakness baby your chicken done come to roost
I think another man would be a fool to try to hang around with you
I'm all done Mister Nice Guy but I ain't playin' around with your rules
If you think that's liquor talkin' you better try an' get on back to school
So mistake kindness for weakness woman you done used up your your
last fool
Needles in my heart spell on my mind
your powerful potion gets me every time
I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
your kiss burns through my dreams
Chorus:
Here it comes again
I don't stand a chance
Soul possession
got me in a trance
Pullin' me back to you
Deja voodoo
Fire in the dark pounding in my brain
driven by the chant calling out my name
I toss and turn I can't sleep
your kiss burns through my dreams
Needles in my heart spell on my mind
your powerful potion gets me every time
I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
your kiss burns through my dreams
Chorus:
Here it comes again
I don't stand a chance
Soul possession
got me in a trance
Pullin' me back to you
Deja voodoo
Oh darling what happened to that beautiful smile
The ones you gave me any time we were face to face
Oh is it someone else taking my place
Oh baby what happened
Oh what happened to those fast heartbeats
The ones that excited me so
Oh tell me don't you love me
Oh baby don't you care any more
Darling what happened
Oh it's so sad what a little time can do
Oh when you're hanging out with another
Losing a love with you
All those good times we had
Baby just me and you
Oh darling before I go
There's one thing I'd like to know
Don't you love me
Don't you care any more
Darling what happened
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
I done called up the bossman
Told him where to go
And just what to do
Call me crazy
But i did what I had to do
You can call me stupid
I just did what I had to do
I had to steal a little time baby
So I could spend it all on you
I parked the car down the street
And I unplugged the phone
So it would look just like
Ain't nobody home
I put a rose on your pillow
Where you lay your pretty head
I'm gonna rub your tired shoulders
Bring your dinner to your bed
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
I had to steal a little time baby
So I could spend it all on you
I'm gonna light a candle
Put the champagne on ice
And if one ain't enough
Well we'll just have to do it twice
I done made myself a will
And I've called my next of kin
'Cause I'm gonna love you over
And over and over
Again and again
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
I had to steal a little time baby
So I could spend it all on you
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
Look out baby
I'm in a dangerous mood
I just this one last paycheck baby
And I'm gonna spend every dime on you

I want to be close to you baby as I can get
Close to you baby as water is wet
Close to you baby as a hair on your head
Close to you babe you better believe what I said
I want to be close to you baby
yeah let me be close to you
I want to be close to you darlin'
'til you don't know what to say or do
I want to be close to you baby as white is to rice
Close to you baby as cold is to ice
Close to you baby as a fire is to smoke
Close to you baby as a pig is to pork
I want to be close to you baby
who let me be close to you
I want to be close to you darlin'
'til you don't know what to say or do
I said closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby haha
Closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby
I want to be close to you darlin'
'til you don't know what to say or do
I want to be close to you baby as the whites of your eyes
Close to you baby as cold is to ice
Close to you baby as an egg is to a hen
Close to you baby as Siamese twins
I want to be close to you baby
whoa let me be close to you
I want to be close to you darlin'
'til you don't know what to say or do
In my home of sand outside the city of gold
Well the wind's so burning hot but my heart remains so cold
I need to buy myself some answers but the truth's already been sold
Well I know how to use a razor carve my initials in the light
Yes I know how to use a razor carve my initials in the light
Sometimes in the depth of the dark baby I can make everything all right
In my home of sand outside the city of gold
Well the wind's so burning hot but my heart remains so cold yes it does
The shelter in your eyes I dream about it when I die
Thirst for it when I cry yeah
My home of sand outside the city of gold
Well the wind's so burning hot but my heart remains so cold it does
The shelter in your eyes I dream about it when I die
Thirst for it when I cry
Yeah na na
Oh my meal of salt on that table of stone
And my meal of salt on that table of stone yeah
Your feat's so sweet while I thirst here all alone
My home of sand outside the city of gold
Well the wind's so burning hot but my heart remains so cold yes it does
I need to buy myself some aspirin
but the truth's already been sold
Headin' for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of my hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
And hear the lonesome whistle see the smoke from the stack to pal around
With democratic fellow named Mac
So take me right back to the track Jack
Choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie woo-woo
Woo-woo ch'boogie choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack
You reach your destination but you don't go back
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situations from the front to the back
But the only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack Jack
Choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie woo-woo
Woo-woo ch'boogie choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack
Gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life O'Riley in the beat down shack
When I hear a whistle I can peep thru the crack
Watch the train rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
Love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
So take me right back to the track Jack
Choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie woo-woo
Woo-woo ch'boogie choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack
Take me right back to the track Jack
I'm not feeling like I usually do
I think it might have something
To do with you
Every time you're near me
My body gets hot
Don't need a doctor
I know what I've got
Caught a touch of your love
It came on overnight
I must have held you too tight
Last night
Caught a touch of your love
Your affection has affected me
I'm feeling kind of dizzy
And weak in the knees
I've been in love before
But never so bad
You're in my system
And it's driving me mad
The fever from your kisses
Tears me apart
It starts from your lips
And goes straight to my heart
No use pretending
'Cause baby I'm sure
There's no cure
And I've just gotta have more
I cry for love that's gone
A love that can't be mine
Well I'll pay every day for loving you
Darling deep down inside
How am I gonna tell you
How am I gonna let you know
That night and day I think about you
And it's killing me slow
The temptation of you is oh so strong
I know I can't have you
Why can't I leave you alone
Oh I know that this trouble
Oh it's here to stay
That's why I'm keeping me distance
Oh I'm praying that you come my way
Praying that you come my way
Oh praying that you come my way
The temptation of you is oh so strong
I know I can't have you
Why can't I leave you alone
Oh I want you to come see me
Oh late at night
That's when we'll pull down the shades darling
And we'll turn down the lights
Ooo I don't want to hurt myself
Don't want to drive you away
That's why I'm keeping my distance
Oh I'm praying that you come my way
Praying that you come my way
Oh praying that you come my
Oh praying that you come my way
Walking with my baby she got great big feet
Long lean and cranky and ain't had nothing to eat
But she's my baby I love her just the same
I'm crazy about my baby 'cause Caldonia is her name
Caldonia Caldonia
What makes your big head so hard
I love you I love you just the same
I'm crazy about you baby 'cause Caldonia is your name
You know my mother told me to leave Caldonia alone
No kidding that what she said
She said "Son the woman ain't no good leave her alone"
But mama didn't know what Caldonia had been putting down
So I'm going down to Caldonia's house and ask her just one more time
Caldonia Caldonia
What makes your big head so hard
I love you love you just the same
I'm crazy about you baby 'cause Caldonia is your name

Buzz me buzz me buzz me baby I'll be waiting for your call
Buzz me buzz me buzz me baby I'll be waiting for your call
But if you forgot the number come on over you won't have to call at all

Buzz me baby I'll be waiting for your call
But if you forgot the number come on over and you won't have to call at all
Buzz me buzz me baby you mean so awfully much to me
Buzz me buzz me baby I'm just like a ship that's lost at sea
But when I get my arm around you ain't gonna let go till
You broke your promise baby
You don't love honor or obey
You won't do nothing I tell you
You go on mistreating me everyday
You're hardly acting your part baby
You won't do nothing the preacher says
You don't love me baby
You don't even wish me well
Honor's just a joke with you baby
You don't love me I can tell
Married life with you baby
I'd rather be living in a cell
You deceive me baby
You use me like a child
You tricked me into loving you baby
I was loving you all the while
You played with my heart baby
I said I was loving you all the while
Up from the ashes out of the flames
Keeps gettin' stronger like a slow rollin' train
Watch it run
Oh why do the good die young
Burnin' like a shootin' star
Born with a broken heart
Off in the distance it was callin' my name
So I took me a ride on that slow rollin' train
It still runs
But it seems that the good die young
Playin' on that sad guitar
Born with a broken heart
Burnin' like a shootin' star
Born with a broken heart
Seems it was over before it begun
Killed by a bullet from a six-string gun
Bang a drum
Oh why do the good die young
Ridin' in a long black car
Born with a broken heart
Playin' on that sad guitar
Born with a broken heart
Burnin' like a shootin' star
Born with a broken heart
Look up on the wall baby
hand me down my shootin' iron
Look up on the wall baby
hand me down my shootin' iron
Call your mother long distance
tell her to expect your body home
If the city don't bury you baby
Lord knows the county will
If the city don't bury you baby
Lord knows the county will
You made your last mistake
you going way out on that boot hill
Lord I don't want to whacks you darlin'
'cause you gave me my first thrill
Lord I don't want to whacks you baby
'cause you gave me my first thrill
You did me so wrong
you're going way out on that boot hill
I've traveled for miles around
Seems like everybody wanna put me down
Because I'm a bluesman
But I'm a good man understand
I went down to the bus station
Look upon the wall
My money is to light people
Couldn't go no where at all
I'm a bluesman
But I'm a good man understand
The burden that I carry oh is so heavy
It seems like ain't nobody in this great big world
That would wanna wanna help old B
Hey but I'll I would be all right people
Just give me a break good things come
The those wait and I've waited a long time
I'm a bluesman
But I'm a good man understand
Yes you're on the top now baby but don't nothing stay the same
Hey you're on the top now baby but don't nothing stay the same
Every now and then baby lady luck deals another hand
You're calling me your pal now when I used to be your man
Hey you're calling me your pal now baby when I used to be your man
You're flying real high now baby go on and raise your sand
I realize now baby your kind of love ain't true
Hey I realize now baby your kind of love won't do
Well what should've been baby now has all fell through
Night falls
I'm alone
Skin yeah
chilled me to the bone
You turned and you ran
oh slipped from the edge of my hand
Blue on black
tears on a river
Push on a shove
it don't mean much
Whisper on a scream
doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black
Blind oh
now I see
truth lies
and in between
Wrong
can't be undone
Slipped
from the tip of your tongue
Blue on black
tears on a river
Push on a shove
it don't mean much
Whisper on a scream
doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black
Hey fellas yes you fellas listen to me I got something to tell you
And I want you to listen to every word and govern yourselves accordingly
Now you see these girls with these fine diamonds fine furs and fine clothes
Well they're looking for a husband and you're listening to a man who knows
They ain't foolin' and if you fool around with them
You're gonna get yourself in a schoolin'
Listen if she saves you dough and won't go to the show
Beware
If she's easy to kiss and won't resist
Beware
And if you go for a walk and she listens while you talk
She's tryin' to hook you
And nobody's lookin' and she asks you to taste her cookin'
Don't do it don't do it
And if you go to a show and she wants to sit in the back row
Bring her down front bring her right down front
If you wanna go for a snack and she wants to sit in the booth in the back
Beware
And listen if she's used to caviar and fine silk
When you go out with her she wanna a hot dog and a malted milk
She's trying to get you
If you're used to goin' to Carnegie Hall but when you take her out night club'ing
All she wants is one meatball
You better take it easy
If she grabs your hand and says "Darling you're such a nice man"
Beware I'm telling you
Should I tell them no more
Tell them everything
You better listen to me 'cause I'm telling you what's being put down
You better pick up on it
If her sister calls your brother you better get further
I'm telling you you better watch it
And if she's acting kind of wild and she says "Darling give me a trial"
Don't you do it don't be weak don't give it to her
And if she smiles in your face and just melts into place
Let her melt forget it let her melt
Should I tell them no more
Tell them everything
Now listen if she calls you up on the phone and says
"Darling are you all alone"
Tell her "No no I've got two three women with me"
Don't pay no attention to women
Stand up for your right be a man be a man
Are you listening
If you turn out the lights and she don't fight
That's the end it's too late
She's got you hooked you might as well stick with her
Should I tell them no more
If you get home about two and don't know what to do
You pull back the curtains and the whole family's looking at you
Get your business straight
Set the date don't be late
Brother beware beware beware
Brother you better beware
I've been wrong wrong for so long
Living life like this I just can't go on
Without a helping hand
I just can't seem to find my way
So I'll keep waiting waiting for my better days
Better Days
Now I said a prayer last night
when my day was through
That I could live my life
the way the Lord would want me to
'Cause without a helping hand
I just can't seem to find my way
So I'll keep waiting waiting for my better days
Better Days
Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours
'Cause there's a pain in my heart
Oh that I've just got to cure
Please please baby won't you take me in
There's been too many times I needed to find a true friend
Say you'll always always tell the truth to me
'Cause there's been too many times
that I've been lied to and deceived
and somehow I got lost and now I can't find my way
Oh I guess I'll keep waiting waiting for my better days
Better Days
Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours
'Cause there's a pain in my heart
Oh that I've just got to cure
and somehow I got lost and now I can't find my way
Oh I guess I'll keep waiting waiting for my better days
Better Days
Got a bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
People my heart is full of misery
I live in loneliness never get no rest
Went to see a love doctor to get out of this mess
Took a look at me before he cast his spell
Shook his head and then began to yell
You gotta bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
People my heart is full of misery
I said #;Doctor doctor please do something for me
I feel like a man going through the third degree
Can#;t sleep at night can#;t eat a bit"
Since you been gone nothin' ever goes right
You gotta bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
People my heart is full of misery
He said son I know just how you feel
You love your little baby and you always will
But your puff is short your breathin' weak
It won#;t be long before you#;re feet deep
You gotta bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
Got a bad case of love
People my heart is full of misery
From Hollywood and Vine
To the Sunset Strip
There's so much going on
You can lose your grip
From early in the morning
Until late at night
They'll do you so wrong
They'll do you so right
Back in LA
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in LA
Living down a life of crime
Back in LA
Working on another line
Back in LA
To pick up the dime
You must do the time
From way up in the canyons
Where the hot winds howl
To the mean city streets
Where the night hawks prowl
I can feel the rhythm play
The whole night long
Guess I'll stay in LA
And listen to this song
Back in LA
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in LA
Living down a life of crime
Back in LA
Working on another line
Back in LA
To pick up the dime
You must do the time
You must do the time
If you love me baby
Why don't you write me sometime
If you if you love me baby
Why don't you let me
Hear from you sometime
You don't do nothing
But keep me worried
You just keep me worried
All the time
You know I think about you baby
I think about you
Every night about this time
Oh you know you know
You know I think about you baby
I think about you
Every night about this time
It seems like you would treat me
A little better baby
It seems like you would be
A little nicer and kind
Let me love you one more time baby
Let me love you one more time
Before you go away
Let me let me love you
One more time baby
One more time before you go away
If you let me love you one more time
I think we can talk it over
Before you go away
Here I am baby
My heart's right here in my hand
Oh here I am baby
My heart's right here in my hand
Oh I don't want you to leave me baby
Don't want you to go
To no other man
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last
The sky above is blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never ever known
You you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last
I found a dream I found a dream
That I could speak to baby
A dream that I can definitely call my own
I found a thrill I found a thrill
To press my cheek to to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never ever known
You smiled you smiled baby
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
Yeah yeah yeah for you are mine
At last
You are mine at last
At last
You're mine baby
There is nothing I can do as you leave me here to cry
There is nothing I can do as you leave me here to cry
You know my love will follow you as the years go passing by
Give you all that I own that's one thing you can't deny
Give you all that I own that's one thing you can't deny
You know my love will follow you as the years go passing by
Gonna leave it up to you so long so long goodbye
Gonna leave it up to you so long so long goodbye
You know my love will follow you as the years go passing by
Gonna leave it up to you so long so long goodbye
Gonna leave it up to you so long so long goodbye
You know my love will follow you as the years go passing
None of my business getting all of my concern
Tried to put out the fire but the flame still burns
And as she pleases she comes and goes
She's got the wind in her hair
She never ceases to hurt me so
Does she really care
Is she ever coming home
Is she ever gonna phone
Another night alone
Has anybody seen my girl
Has anybody seen my woman
California Tennessee
Send my baby home to me
Where am I going oh what am I gonna do
I know I'm not crazy I'm just hooked on you
So go on and use me endlessly
Could you let me know
When you need me hold me close
And baby don't let go
Are you ever coming home
Are you ever gonna phone
Another night alone
Has anybody seen my girl
Has anybody seen my woman
California Tennessee
Send my baby home to me
Has anybody seen my girl
Has anybody seen my woman
California Tennessee
Send my baby home to me

You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone
Well now my bed is empty my feets and my hands are cold
You know my bed is empty my feets and my hands are cold
Come on home Angelina my love for you will never grow old
Well now I've tried to love you with diamonds and pearls

I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child that's grown old
If dreams were thunder
And lightnin' was desire
This old house would'a burned down
A long time ago
Make me an angel to fly from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl
I had me a cowboy
He wasn't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
Aw but that was a long time
And no matter how I try
Those years they just flow by
Like a broken-down dam
Make me an angel to fly from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear 'em a-buzzin'
But I ain't done nothin'
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the mornin'
And come home in the evenin'
And have nothin' to say
Make me an angel to fly from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
Am I wrong fallin' in love with you
tell me am I wrong well fallin' in love with you
While your other man was out there
cheatin' and lyin' steppin' all over you
Uh sweet thing
Tell me am I wrong holdin' on to you so tight
Tell me tell me am I wrong holdin' on to you so tight
If your other man come to claim you
he'd better be ready ready for a long long fight
Well I gotta be strong well I know you're dependin' on me
You know I gotta be strong I know you're dependin' on me
To give you all of my attention
all of my time and all of the love you need
Oh tell me am I wrong tryin' to hold on to you
Tell me am I wrong tryin' to hold on to you
I just wanna make a home for you baby
and all of your children too
Tell me am I wrong fallin' in love with you
Gotta tell me am I wrong fallin' in love with you
While your other man was out there
cheatin' and lyin' steppin' all over you
While your other man was out there
cheatin' and lyin' steppin' all over you
Wo the love I miss lovin' all the kiss I miss kissin'
Wo the love I miss lovin' all the kiss I miss kissin'
Before I met you baby I didn't know what I was missin'

I gave you a diamond ring you won't wear
It's a nine thousand dollar thing you don't care
I set up a wedding date you couldn't make it
You said all the love we made you were just faking
But girl you know what hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you all you ever give me
All you ever give me all you ever give me is the blues
Is the blues
I gave you my Cadillac keys you don't drive
I hired you a limousine you won't ride
Bought you the house on the hill you hate the view
Even wrote you into my will gave you something to look forward to
But girl you know what hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever give me is the blues
Nothing but the blues
I've tried and tried but I'm mystified
I've done all that I can do I've given you my best
You put me to the test
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever give me is the blues
Nothing but the blues
But girl you know what hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever gave me was the blues
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me was the blues
Nothing but the blues
There was Adam happy as a man could be
Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time
Lot took his wife down to the corner for a malted
She wouldn't mind her business boy did she get salted
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time
Samson thought Delilah was on the square
Till one night she clipped him all his hair
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time
From our history books we all learned
Nero fiddled while Rome was burned
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time
Marie Antoinette met some hungry cats at the gate
They was crying for bread she said "Let them eat cake"
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time
You can buy a woman clothes
And give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time
If I attend church all day Sunday
Lord I come back home and want to raise hell all day Monday
Lord it ain't nobody's business if I do
If my baby comes up to me and says I ain't got no money
I just got to reach into my pocket
and say take all of my money honey
Ain't nobody's business if that's what I want to do
Ain't nobody's business it just ain't nobody's business
Oh it ain't nobody's business what I do
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I ever get the notion to jump off into the Atlantic Ocean
It ain't nobody's business if that's what I want to do
Me and my baby we might fuss and fight
But with the Lord's help I know everything is gonna be alright
Oh and it ain't nobody's business what we do
Ain't nobody's business it just ain't nobody's business
Oh it ain't nobody's business what I do
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I attend church all day Sunday come back home and raise
Spoken I think I feel hurt or shall I go a little further do a little more
Ain't nobody's bizness what I do
If one day I have ham and bacon and the next day ain't nothin' shakin'
No it ain't nobody's bizness what I do
One night farmer Brown was takin' the air
Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
Down in the hen house something stirred
When he shouted "Who's there"
This is what he heard
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So calm yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble hobble hobble hobble with your chin
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
You're stompin' around and shakin' the ground
Kicking up an awful dust
We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble hobble hobble hobble it's a sin
Tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin' gettin' chicks to hatch
Oh there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
Kindly point the gun the other way
And hobble hobble hobble hobble off and hit the hay
Tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin' gettin' chicks to hatch
Oh there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
Kindly point the gun the other way
And hobble hobble hobble hobble off and hit the hay
Hey hey boss man what do you say
It's easy pickin's there ain't nobody here but us chickens
I was over in Aberdeen
on my way to New Orleans
I was over in Aberdeen
on my way to New Orleans
Well them Aberdeen women told me
they would give me my gasoline
Aberdeen is my home
but they just don't want me around
Aberdeen is my home
but they just don't want me around
I'm gonna take these women
take them out this town
Well just look over yonder
coming down the road
Well just look over yonder
coming down the road
That must be my baby coming
tell me she don't want me no more
Well there's too many women
I ain't never seen
Well there's too many women
I ain't never seen
I bring too many women
back from New Orleans
I was standin' 'round cryin'
with my heart right in my hand
I was standin' 'round cryin'
with my heart right in my hand
I was lookin' for that woman
one ain't got no man
Well just look over yonder
where we used to live
Well just look over yonder
where we used to live
Don't you know it's killing me baby
how we can't live here no more
Well it's goodbye baby
If I'm never gonna see you no more
Well it's goodbye baby
if I'm never gonna see you no more
I'm gonna tell everybody you've been
still knockin' at my door
I don't have a reason
To turn you around
I don't have all the reasons
To turn you around
I ain't going nowhere baby
No how no way
You're not always an angel baby
And I ain't no saint
You're not always an angel baby
And I ain't no saint
Well I know I'm gonna leave you baby
Well baby that something I ain't
I don't have a reason
To turn you around
I don't have a reason
To turn you around
I ain't going nowhere
No way no how
My love is like a rock
Not a fair-weathered friend
My love is like a rock
I ain't no fair-weathered friend
I#;ll follow you up the mountain
Down the road and back again
I don't have no trophy
To prove I'm a man
I don't need no trophy
To prove I'm a man
I just want somebody to talk to
So I can be free
I don't have a reason
Sorry about that false alarm
Turned you around
I ain't got all the reasons
To make you stay
I ain't going nowhere
No how no way
Sittin' here in my problem
What am I gonna do now
Am I gonna make it
Someway somehow
Maybe I'm not supposed to know
Maybe I'm supposed to cry
And if nobody ever knows
The way I feel
It's all right
And it'll be ok
Chorus:
I'm gonna make my world a better place
I'm gonna keep that smile on my face
I'm gonna teach myself how to understand
I'm gonna make myself a better man
Climbing out of the window
Climbing up the wall
Is anybody gonna save me
Or are they gonna let me fall
Well I don't really wanna know
I#;ll just hold on the best I can
And if I fall down
I#;ll just get back up
It'll be alright
It'll be ok
Chorus x
Maybe I'm not supposed to know
Maybe I'm supposed to cry
And if nobody ever knows
The way I feel
That's all right
It'll be ok
Chorus x
