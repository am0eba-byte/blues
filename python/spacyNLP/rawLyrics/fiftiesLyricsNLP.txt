Well and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right
You fix her breakfast in the morning
Stay at home everyday

If she has to go away
You send the children to school
Even mend their hose
Stay up all nights with the babies
Even wash their dirty clothes
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Yes and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right
But when it's time to go to bed
The woman grabs you in her arms
She holds you real tight
She hugs you with all her charms
She calls you a lot of sweet names
Then she turns out the light
She sets your soul on fire
And you say "Baby everything is all right"
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Yes and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right
Lord I've got a woman she's nice lovin' in ev'ryway

She said "Bring me some flowers be sure honey on ev'ry decoration
