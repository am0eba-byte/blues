Ain't no need to worry about it
Won't do you one bit of good
If you don't treat your baby
Treat your baby like you should
There's been a change in the weather
And it's so plain to see
So plain to see
Everybody's welcome to try
Try and get my airplane running
You're the only one can make it fly
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit
Don't be listening to no jealous friends
When they start slinging mud
And don't let nobody come between
'Cause I've got you in my blood
I wanna start dealing dealing
Dealing in reality reality
I'm just trying to survive
And keep my head above the waterline
So I won't get buried alive
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit
Not so very long ago
There was nothing you could say
That ever would
Have convinced me darling
I couldn't turn and walk away
You got me stung out baby
Stung out on the end of your line
Yeah and the hook's in deep
Got the kind of love
Kind of love I wanna keep
Everybody's welcome to try
Try and get my airplane running
You're the only one can make it fly
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit to me
You've become a habit
No matter how hard I try
I just can't break free
You've become a habit to me
'Cause you're my honey and I'm your bee
A habit to me
I said -
You've become a habit to me
Habit to me habit to me
I wake up and think of her
No matter what I do
She's always on my mind
A time a day or two
Seems to me the things you've loved the most
You always lose
But once you've got them
You've always got the blues
In time well you may find someone else
That can comfort you
But not someone to light the fire
No not the way she used to do
You lose the things that made it
What it was when it was new
And once you've got them
You've always got the blues
That new love only can replace
Just so much of you
That leaves a lot that gets lost between
Number one and number two
In time well you may find someone else
That can comfort you
But not someone to light the fire
No not the way she used to do
You lose the things that made it
What it was when it was new
And once you've got them
You've always got the blues
You talk too much you talk too much
I can't believe the things that you say everyday
If you keep on talking baby
you know you're bound to drive me away
Now you get on the telephone with your girlfriend
your conversation baby ain't got no end
Yakety-yakety-yakety-yak all the time
you keep on talking baby drive me out of my mind
You talk too much
I can't believe the things that you say everyday
If you keep on talking baby
you know you're bound to drive me away
Well I laid out in the afternoon I start to nappin'
you walk into the room with them jaws a-flappin'
You keep that motormouth moving morning noon and night
you keep on talking baby make my head turn white
You talk too much
I can't believe the things that you say everyday
If you keep on talking baby
you know you're bound just to drive me away
I think you're trying to put me through some kind of test
I'm begging you baby won't you give it a rest
You talk about people that you don't even know
keep it up baby I'm gonna pick up and blow
You talk too much
I can't believe the things that you say everyday
If you keep on talking baby
you know you're bound to drive me away
Don't get me wrong baby I don't mean to complain
but if you keep on talking you're gonna drive me insane
You keep on talking all around the clock
I'm begging you baby won't you please stop
You talk too much
I can't believe the things that you say everyday
If you keep on talking baby
you know you're bound to drive me away
You so sweet you so fine
How I wish you were mine
Honey I'll be your love
You'll be mine you'll be mine
You so nice you so true
I'm so glad I love you
Honey I'll be your love
You'll be mine you'll be mine

It's true I love you
I don't care what you do
Honey I'll be your love
You'll be mine you'll be mine
You'll be mine you'll be mine
You took me way back in the country
You fed me on love and greens
You laid my head upon a feather bed
And I sure had some mighty sweet dreams
Don't you know we got something going on
You and me me and you
Love can be a song if you like the tune
So sing to me I'll sing to you
It goes ooh -
Just let the feelings flow
It goes ooh -
That's the way our love song goes
Mornings come easy in the country
Never had this feeling before
Ever since you found me
Love has been around me
And I'll never be lonely no more
Don't you know we got something going on
You and me me and you
Love can be a song if you like the tune
So sing to me I'll sing to you
It goes ooh -
Just let the feelings flow
It goes ooh -
That's the way our love song goes
I've been watchin' you for days now baby
I just love your sexy ways now baby
Ya know our love will never stop now baby
Just put your lovin' in my box now baby
Chorus x
Well no more will I shop around now baby

I just love your sexy ways now baby
Ya know our love will never stop now baby
Just put your lovin' in my box now baby
Chorus x
Willie the Wimp was buried today
they laid him to rest in a special way
Sent him off in the finest style
that casket-mobile really drove 'em wild
Southside Chicago will think of him often
talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
That casket it looked like a fine Seville
he had a vanity license and a cadillac grille
Willie was propped up in the driver's seat
he had diamonds on his fingers and a smile sweet
Fine red suit had the whole town talkin'
talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
Oh cadillac to heaven he was wavin' the banner
he left like he lived in a lively manner
With a-hundred dollar bills in his fingers tight
he had flowers for wheels and a-flashin' headlights
He been wishin' for wings no way he was walkin'
talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
Yeah Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
You get the strangest kinda feelin' that's when the guitar plays the blues
I say you get the strangest kinda feelin' that's when a guitar plays the blues
Your body gets the message and you know you know your soul has just got to move
You might even bat your eye
You might even snap or cry
The feelin' you're feelin' within you babe
You know you just can't hide
You're kinda strokin' like that
You're kinda bendin' like this
And it reaches down inside you
And your soul just can't resist
You get the same kinda feelin'
When the guitar plays the blues
Your body sure gets the message
Yes you know you know your soul has just got to move
And when the music is over
And it's time to turn out the lights
You know the blues goes home with ya
Soothes you through the night
You get the strange kinda feelin'
When the guitar plays the blues
Your body gets the message
And you know you know you know
Your soul has just got to move
A wall of denial is fallin' down
Wo it's fallin' so hard own to the ground
Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears
but this wall of denial was just built on fear
We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies
dressed them amused them pullin' wool over our eyes
Go so far as to love them to keep from letting them go
all the while they we're killin' us but we couldn't let it show
No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
down to the ground
Simple things in life bring the greatest pleasure
a smile a kiss a little baby's laughter
It makes no difference if we run away in fear
the little things in life hold us so near
No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
Yeah this wall of denial must tumble down
Down to the ground
Well I don't live like a king
And I don't drive a big car
The gypsy woman was right
When she said I would go far
Just wait on time baby
I'll be there one day
Yeah and until I get there baby
All I can do is hope and pray
Well you say you'll stick with me baby
Stick with me through thick and thin
I know someday baby
My bad luck has got to end
Just wait on me baby
I'll be there one day
Yes and until I get there baby
All I can do is hope and pray
Well you say you'll stick with me baby
Stick with me through thick and thin
I know someday baby
My bad luck has got to end
Just wait on time baby
I'll be there one day
Yes and until I get there baby
All I can do is hope and pray
Well I live the life I love
And I love the life I live
The life I live baby
Is all I have to give
So just wait on me baby
We'll be there one day
Yes and until I get there baby
All I can do is hope and pray
Well you just got to wait on time baby
Yes just wait on time baby
Yeah-heah be good to me baby
Because until I get there baby
All I can do is hope and pray
Well I'm standin' next to a mountain Chopin' down with the edge of my hand
Well I'm standin' next to a mountain Chopin' down with the edge of my hand
Pick up the pieces make an island might even raise a little sand
'Cause I'm a voodoo
chile Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
give it right back to you one of these days
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
give it right back to you the rest of my days
I won't see you again in this world see ya in the next one
don't be late don't be late
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile yeah Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile
I would walk two miles on my hands and knees
ain't no doubt about it baby it's you I aim to please
I'd wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear
it's my life baby but I don't care
Ain't that tuff enough
Ain't that tuff enough
Ain't that tuff enough
Ain't that tuff enough
For you baby I would swim the sea
nothin' I'd do for you that's too tough for me
I'd put out a burnin' building with a shovel and dirt
and not even worry about getting hurt
I would work hours days a week
just so I can come home and kiss your cheek
I love you in the mornin' and I love a-you at noon
I love you in the night take you to the moon
Lain to buy my burnin' money that I've earned
and not even worry about gettin' burned
I'd climb the Empire State fight Mohammed Ali
just to have you baby close to me
True love is hard to find
True love is hard to find
Well just like good wine
Never gets served before it's time
Baby be true to me
Like I'm true to you
Well stick around or set me free
Baby that's what you got to do
It takes a lot of lovin' to fill my lovin' cup
Make it overflow till I can't get enough
I like it in the light
I like it in the dark
Well I like it on lover's lane
I like it in the pouring rain
Well bring it on over bring it on over to me
Well you and I together that's the way
I want it to be
Baby come take my hand
Tryin' to make you understand
Well I love you you see
Baby come on and go with me
Well bring it on over bring it on over to me
Well you and I together that's the way
I want it to be
Baby come take my hand
Tryin' to make you understand
Well I love you you see
Baby come on and go with me
Too many dirty dishes in the sink for just us two
I said too many dirty dishes in the sink for just us two
You got me wonderin' baby
Who's makin' dirty dishes with you
I get up an' go to work in the mo'nin'
I come right home at night
When I leave the sink is empty
When I come back home
She got 'em stacked up out of sight
Too many dirty dishes in the sink just for us two
Well you got me wonderin' baby
Who's makin' dirty dishes with you
Spoken:
Look at this kitchen
Pots an' pans ev'rywhere it's pitiful
Look at all these glasses layin' all up on the sink
Looks like she even had a party up in here too
You wait 'til I see this woman when she get home
That glass over there got a cigar in it or sump'in
I don't smoke no cigar
Um servin' caviar
I don't eat no caviar
What's wrong with this woman
All these pots in here gonna run me some water right here
Yeah now you wait 'til I see this woman when she get home
Pots 'n pans all stacked up here
There's a pot let me scrap this pot out
Oh it's pitiful an' I don't know why this woman come an' have a party
When I'm at work
Gettin' all this stuff under my fingernails
Run some more water in here
Yeah now I can wash these glasses out wash them up first
Yeah that's pretty clean now though
Now I got all this now I gotta work on these pots a little bit more
Makes me so mad I don't know what to do
Thought I was her husband 'stead a maid
Like ol red chili or somethin' all done got dried up on all these pots
She never fix me none of this good food
You wait 'til that woman get home I'm scrappin' all these pots for her
Sings:
I've done your dirty dishes
How much am I suppose to take
When I left I had corn flakes for breakfast
Now there's a bone from a T-bone steak
Too many dirty dishes in the sink for just us two
You've got me wonderin' baby
Who in the hell is makin' dirty dishes with you
Went down to Tin Pan Alley see what was going on
Things was too hot down there couldn't stay very long
Hey hey hey hey alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there livin' for their whisky wine and gin
I heard a woman scream yeah and I peeked through the door
Some cat was workin' on Annie with a Lord with a two-by-four
Hey hey hey hey alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there livin' for their whisky wine and gin
I heard a pistol shoot yeah and it was a
Somebody killed a crap shooter cause he didn't shake rattle and roll
Hey hey hey hey alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there killin' for their whisky wine and gin
I saw a cop standin' with his hand on his gun
Said "This is a raid boys nobody run"
Hey Hey Hey alley's the roughest place I've ever been
Yeah they took me away from tin pan alley
And took me right back to the pen
Caught up in a whirlwind can't catch my breath
knee deep in hot water broke out in a cold sweat
Can't catch a turtle in this rat race
feels like I'm losin' time at a breakneck pace
Afraid of my own shadow in the face of grace
heart full of darkness spotlight on my face
There was love all around me but I was lookin' for revenge
thank God it never found me would have been the end
I was walkin' the tightrope steppin' on my friends
Walkin' the tightrope it was a shame and a sin
Walkin' the tightrope between wrong and right
Walkin' the tightrope both day and night
Lookin' back in front of me in the mirror's a grin
through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend
We've all had our problems that's the way life is
my heart goes out to others who are there to make amends
We've been walkin' the tightrope tryin' to make it right
Walkin' the tightrope every day and every night
Walkin' the tightrope bring it all around
Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found
Walkin' the tightrope stretched around the world
Walkin' the tightrope save the boys and girls
Walkin' the tightrope let's make it right
Walkin' the tightrope do it do it tonight
Walkin' the tightrope
Think twice before you go baby this will be the end
Think twice before you go baby this will be the end
You done leave me one time baby you'll leave again
Dig in and suffer with me an' I know you paid your dues
Dig in and suffer with me baby an' I know you paid your dues
You done leave me when I need you then I know you stand accused
Doing the man who loves you wrong
Breaking the heart you should be ruling
Doing the man who loves you wrong
I go for a lot of things but you're a little too strong
Think twice before you go baby this will be the end
Think twice before you go baby this will be the end
You done leave me one time baby you'll leave again
Ha
The things that I used to do Lord I won't do no more
The things that I used to do Lord I won't do no more

The time has come I got to hit the road again
I said the time has come I've got to hit the road again
'Cause I travel with a passion and the highway is my lady friend
You see the highway's like a woman soft shoulders an' dangerous curves
You see the highway is like a woman like a woman soft shoulders an' dangerous curve
If you don't know her when you start travelin' boy she can really upset your nerves
But if you respect her when she warns you I swear the highway treat you fine
But if you respect her when she warn you I swear the highway'll treat you fine
When she's wet an' she's slippery then watch out for the detour

It rained last night
And things ain't right
Without my baby home
Every time it rains
I think of you
And that's the time
I feel so blue
When the rain starts falling
My love comes tumbling down
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes
If you see clouds
Here in my eyes
It's just because
You said good-bye
Although the sun is shining
There's no more summer skies
'Cause it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes
Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby won't you hurry
Because I miss you so
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes
Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby won't you hurry
Because I miss you so
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes
If you're gonna walk on my love baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
Yeah if you're gonna walk on my love baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
Yes how can you hurt me so bad baby
After I've been so good to you
Coming home last night about half past ten
I saw you with another man baby
Coming out of the Dewdrop Inn
You know I recognized the dress
I bought you baby
To match your red shoes
But you said if I didn't touch you
Hey I could have been used
If you're gonna walk on my love baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
I wanna know how can you hurt me so bad baby
After I've been so good to you
Your love is so good baby
You know it's hard to complain
But I've been out here knocking about fifteen minutes
In this cold pouring rain
I hear the music played inside
So you know I know you're at home
Who's in there with you baby
I believe you are doing me wrong
If you're gonna walk on my love baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
I wanna know how can you hurt me so bad baby
After I've been so good to you

I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life
And it's the only life I know
Street life
And there's a thousand parts to play
Street life
Until you play your life away
You let the people see
Just who you want to be
And every night you shine just like a super star
That's how the life is played
A ten cent Masquerade
You dress and walk and talk you're who you think you are
Street life
You can run away from time
Street life
For a nickel and a dime
Street life
But you better not get old
Street life
Or you're gonna feel the cold
There's always love for sale
A grown-up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young
Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way beneath the silver moon
Late last night I was dreaming
I was dreaming of your charms
I was standing
On the edge of love darling
With you in my arms
Well you whispered sweet things
And told me
That you loved me and always be true
And you'd stand
On the edge of love with me
If I'd stand with you
I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love darling
Waiting on your call
You know I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love darling
Waiting on you one more time
Now a young man's mind will wander
Wander to distant shores
If you'll just come here
And stand with me
I won't wander no more
I promise to stop all of my gambling
Even stop staying out late all night
Might even settle down and have babies
Treat ourselves right
'Cause a young man's dreams are many
Lord so few come true
So if you'll just come here
And stand with me
I'll stand with you
That's why I say you know
I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love darling
Waiting on your call that's why I say
You know I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love darling
Waiting on you one more time
That's why I'm standing standing
Standing yes I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time
That's why I'm standing standing
Standing yes I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time
That's why I'm standing standing
Standing yes I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
One more time

Just a twist of fate they didn't hesitate
now they had another party to lean on
She made him jump and sang he made her share that thing
looks like they gonna have a ball ain't nothin' wrong at all
Wo they gonna have a ball
They got to askin' what if they had to scratch-n-sniff
to find out what it is they are after
Got the ants out their pants 'n' took the chance on romance
made some plans to make it forever
Now several years have gone they still gettin' along
they know what true love is made of
Now they know that life's a trip with all it's bumps and dips

Wine music and a little candlelight
Just to help me unwind
'Cause I know
I got so much love to give baby
And tonight I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Said I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just trying to keep Jody from my door
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Yes I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just gotta keep Jody from my door
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Think I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just trying to keep Jody from my door
Hey Mr President
All your congressmen too
You got me frustrated
And I don't know what to do
I'm trying to make a living
I can't save a cent
It takes all of my money
Just to eat and pay my rent
I got the blues
Got those inflation blues
You know I'm not one
Of those high brows
I'm average Joe to you
I came up eating cornbread
Candied yams and chicken stew
Now you take that paper dollar
It's only that in name
The way that buck has shrunk
It's a lowdown dirty shame
That's why I got the blues
Got those inflation blues
Mr President
Please cut the price of sugar
I wanna make my coffee sweet
I wanna smear some butter on my bread
And I just got to have my meat
When you start rationing
You really played the game
And things are going up
And up and up and up
And my check remains the same
That's why I got the blues
Got those inflation blues

My baby's tryin' to mistreat me and I don't know what to do
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah I've loved her for such a long time to end it all this way
Sittin' here so lonely tears be fallin' just like rain
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah you know I love you baby I'll do anything for you
But when we start to fightin' I just get these same old blues
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah now when I first met you baby at a dance and we did fine
Now we're together and it's a total waste of time
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love you baby I can't live another day
Well I guess it's just my own fault the truth I cannot hide
But if I ever get you back dear I'll stay right by your side
I won't be cryin' I'll stay happy that a way
I'll be lovin' my little baby every night and every day
Oh my darling I was so lonely
Searching for you and for you only
Oh my darling I love you so
Oh my darling my love is true
Longing for you no one else will do
Oh my darling I love you so
When I first saw you dear I knew you were alone
I said to myself that I'd make you my own
Your brother caught us kissing
I though he would surely tell
Until he started playing those wedding bells
Now my darling I'm yours forever
Don't ever leave me leave me never
Oh my darling I love you so
Oh yes it's true now I have you
And best of all I know now
That I'll never have to be blue
Oh baby I love you so
I mean you baby
I'm picking up on a signal that's in the air tonight
It's sparkin' my receiver it feels like dynamite
I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you
My mind is electric I'm about to blow a fuse
The cockpit is empty so shoot it down the tube
I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you
I've got to make a connection I'm on needles and pins
Workin' up a printout and I'm gonna zero in
I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you
Come home this mornin' my woman she treated me like dirt
Just because I had lipstick on my shirt
She looked at me she made a nasty crack
I said "Please please woman get off-a my back"
I got mad got mad baby
Got so mad I got a bad little baby
I got mad you can see
That woman tryin' to beat the hell out-a me
I got the meanest woman that you ever seen
That woman tried to beat the hell out of me
She said "I'm tired of you foolin' around"
Then she picked up a brick an' damn near knocked me down
I got mad got made baby
Got so mad I got a bad little baby
I got mad you can see that woman tryin' to beat the hell out of me
Now I thought of ev'ry night and day

She said "I will take this knife and I will cut off your prick"
I got mad I got mad baby

An' all you when you see me stand here two's in my life
I know you might be wonderin' did I wreck my life
Well I got a problem 'bout my woman ha
I got a problem 'bout my wife
Now my wife is number one my woman is number two
My woman would do things for me that my wife wouldn't do
'Cause I dig my wife but you understand
Sometime it takes two ya'all to satisfy one man
My problem started out
When I started messin' 'round with number three
She called up my wife an' told on my woman an' me
Now my wife packed up her clothes
Went home to her mother
My woman went off an' found another lover
I've got a problem uh huh
I got a problem with my wife
Got a problem with my woman yeah
Got a problem with my wife talk talk talk
If heartaches brought fame
In love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statuettes
For tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time
But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
I'd be a legend in my time
What did I do wrong baby
I tried to keep you satisfied
Whenever you needed me
I was right there by your side
Now tell me
What's the reason baby
What's the reason
You're leaving me
I ain't got nobody else
Baby it's always been you
'Cause there ain't nobody
Ain't nobody else
Can make me feel the way you do
I love you I love you
I love you so baby
You know I just can't
I just can't let you go
I don't know what's wrong with me

Went to the doctor but he don't know

You can send a kid to college
But you can't make him think
You'll never miss your water baby
ill the well runs dry
And you'll never miss me baby
Till I say good-bye
Mm hm you'd better heed my warning
The straw that broke the camel's back
Didn't have to be so big
And when you ran off and left me baby
I almost blew my wig
They say he who has the last laugh
Always laughs the best
And I'm gonna laugh louder baby
Than all the rest
Mm hm baby you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning
If you want me to get out baby
You know you don't have to push
But you'll find a bird in hand
Is worth two in the bush
There's no need to lock the barn door
When the cow is gone
But you're gonna miss me baby
On some frosty dawn
Mm hm you know you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning
It's a long long road
That don't have a turn
You have to be an early bird
If you wanna catch a worm
They say absence makes
The heart grow fonder
So its plain to see
If the grass look greener yonder
Baby that's where I'm gonna be
Mm hm baby you know you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning
I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad
I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad
I work a hundred grand scam from a border town
Well I'll be feeling glad
I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama in a Jeep with a German shepherd by her side
I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama with boots and a on her side
And if I ain't too high or used up I'll have her take me for a groovy little hippie ride
I'm gonna fix brown rice every day and drink down a bottle of Midnight Red
I'm gonna fix brown rice every day and drink down a bottle of Midnight Red
That's all I need to get groovy that's what all the little hippie
said
I said Lord up in heaven
Honey what's been wrong with you

For what we've been going through
Oh go on
'Cause you brought me to my knees
Go on do just what you please
I'd rather you'd just leave me alone
So baby go on
Are you sure you still love me
All you seem to want to do is fight
Always telling me

You've got me on my knees
Go on do just what you please
I'd rather you just leave me alone
So baby go on
Go on go on go on baby go on

Nine long days through twenty-three states

The police catch me I'll end up in the slammer

Something gets in my way you know I'm gonna ram it

Running my rig about ninety-five

You can try to get me back baby with all your tricks and charms

But when all your games are over you'll be left with empty arms
Low down and dead and all alone
Tryin' to tell you baby about your trip
Ev'rytime I talk to ya baby Lord you give me that lip
I know what you mean baby yeah about your past
Ev'rytime I talk to you baby yeah you ain't got no class
You're on an ego trip

"You got that old ego goin' on"
"Gotta school you next week"
"An' I told you to get yourself together now"
"So you can get me them shoes"
"Ya ain't come back wit' 'em yet"
Fading:
"What"
"I told you 'bout that talkin' back"
"What"
I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
I've been out here so very long
I done lost all my direction
Baby when you came my way
Thought I had found my protection
But a strong wind came into my life
It surely took me by surprise
I can't seem to control these tears
That's falling from my eyes
I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
Sea of love
Baby I depended on you
For the love navigation
But now you've gone and deserted me
Can't you see that I'm in desperation
I'm in the middle of a bad love storm
And it's bad as it can be
I look around all I can see
Is water coming down over me
I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
Sea of love sea of love
I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
Sea of love
But right now I'm just drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
A sea of love sea of love
If one thing in this world
I just can't stand
Is bein' at the table wit' an ill-mannered man
Now if he's sittin' on your left
Before you could eat a bite
He'll reach across your plate
An' you know that ain't right
Now I like to eat as well as any man
But there's some rules a fool should understand
When ya have one little helpin'
An' one extra piece of cake
I tell ev'rybody don't go reachin' across my plate
I was at a party last night at over Big Murray
Cat reached 'cross my plate
Got a coat sleeve in my gravy
I didn't say a word just looked him dead in the eye
He reached across my plate an' cut him a piece a pie
Now I don't care if he did it for a prank
I don't care if you had a drink
Especially when I'm out a-with my date
Now don't you go reachin' across MY plate
At a party last week there was some high-class folks
Ev'rything on the table an' that ain't no joke
They had barbecue possum rattlesnake gravy
Chicken fried skunk an' it smelt real crazy
Ev'rything went fine but one thing made me blue
A cat reached across my plate for some armadillo
stew
Now when you at the table you act real nice
You say "pass me that" or "pass me the platter"
But just because you hungry an' happen to come in late
Don't you go reachin' across MY plate
Spoken:
"Pass some a-that turkey over there baby"
"No don't give me none of that skunk I don't want none a-that"
"I I beg your pardon"
"If this cat stop reachin' 'cross my plate I can maybe ask for somethin'"
"A pass me a little a-that turkey there baby"
Fading:
Na na na na-na-na-na
Yeah-heya
"Party' nice party's nice"
"Yeah ah give gimme some a that chicken over there baby"
"Chicken fried skunk "ah no"
Girl you're my sunshine
You chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Just like a river you keep love flowing
Don't let our world stop keep it growing
Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change
I used to wonder where would I find
Some kind of happiness and peace of mind
I was living in darkness
Oh but then you came
Bringing in the sunlight
And easing my pain
Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change
If there's a heaven
Then this is my prayer
Lord knows I want to know you
If we ever should meet there
And then forever we'll walk together
Nothing but sunshine
And no more stormy weather
Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change
True love is gone I's been played for a fool
True love is gone I's been played for a fool
I'm turnin' the tables on you
You've been playin' dirty pool
You said you'd call the shots darlin'
all your friends thought that was cool so cool baby
You said you'd call the shots darlin'
all your friends thought that was so cool
Yeah when you shot at the eight-ball baby
I knew you were playin' dirty pool
They say that life life is a game of give and take
They say that life life is a game of give and take
I'm tellin' you one thing right now little baby
I won't be the one to pay for your mistake
Darlin' darlin' you know I love you
I love you for myself
But you're gone gone and left me for someone else
I think of you think of you every morning
I dream of you every night and with love
love to be with you always
When night began to fall
I cry cry alone
And I wish maybe I can hold you in my arms tonight
Oh darlin' darlin' you know I love you
I love you for myself
But you're gone gone and left me for someone else
Hey hey hey
I'm leavin' leavin' leavin'
won't be back no more
Lord Lord
Lord Lord
Cuttin' out this morning
won't be back no more
Hey
Hey
Won't be back no more
My woman told me "Hit the road Johnny
don't come back no more"
Packed my suitcase
went on down the line
I got down to the station
with suitcase in my hand
The train was leaving
Oh the train would leave the train was leaving
I said "Hold the train conductor I ain't got the time
get a ticket I got money in my hand"
Paid my fare the train started movin'
Paid my fare when the train got movin'
Oh don't stop rollin' 'til the whole state's outta sight
Whole state
Outta sight
Lord Lord Lord
I feel so bad
Hey
I was sittin' way down inside
I was sittin' there cryin' cryin'
The train was movin' the train was movin'
Conductor told me said "Johnny stop cryin' stop cryin'"
Gon' take you 'way from here
Down the line
down the line
down the line
down the line
Woo
Stop crying stop crying stop cryin' stop crying
Takin' you away from here down the line
Ooh
Day by day night after night
blinded by the neon lights
Hurry here hustlin' there
no one's got the time to spare
Money's tight nothin' free
won't somebody come and rescue me
I am stranded caught in the crossfire
Stranded caught in the crossfire
Tooth for tooth eye for an eye
sell your soul just to buy buy buy
Beggin' a dollar stealin' a dime
come on can't you see that I
I am stranded caught in the crossfire
I am stranded caught in the crossfire
I need some kind of kindness
some kind of sympathy oh no
We're stranded caught in the crossfire
Save the strong lose the weak
never turning the other cheek
Trust nobody don't be no fool
whatever happened to the golden rule
We got stranded caught in the crossfire
We got stranded caught in the crossfire
We got stranded caught in the crossfire
Stranded caught in the crossfire
Help me
Runnin' through this business of life
rarely time if I'm needed to
Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right
then daddy's hand helps to see me through
Sweet as sugar love won't wash away
rain or shine it always here to stay
All these years you and I've spent together
all this we just couldn't stand the weather
Like a train that stops at every station
we all deal with trials and tribulations
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years
entangled in yellow and cries all his tears
Changes come before we can grow
learn to see them before we're too old
Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy
understand it's time to get ready for the storm
People talkin' but they just don't know
what's in my heart and why I love you so
I love you baby like a miner loves gold
come on baby let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
come on it soothes my soul
Oh let the good times roll
come on come on come on
A lot of people live in make believe
they keep a lot of dirt up their sleeve
My love baby ain't the kind to fold
come on baby let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
come on an' let it roll
Ah yeah let it roll come on let it roll
Our lovin's nice if it's understood
it's even nicer when you feel so good
You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole
come on sugar let the good times roll
Oh let the good times roll
come on let it roll come on come on
Come on come on come on and let it roll
Once was a sweet thing baby held out her lovin' in our hands
Now I reach to kiss your lips the touch don't mean a thing
And that's a cold shot baby yeah that's a drag
A cold shot baby I let our love go bad
Remember the way that you loved me do anything I said
Now I see you out somewhere you won't give me the time of day
And that's a cold shot darlin' yeah that's a drag
And that's a cold shot baby we let our love go bad
I really meant I was sorry for ever causin' you pain
You showed your appreciation by walkin' out anyway
And that's a cold shot baby yeah that's a drag
And that's a cold shot baby we let our love go bad
So sad too bad so sad
Don't let our true love run cold baby
You can't change it
can't rearrange it
If time is all that we got
then baby let's take it
Lovin' is a lovin'
the moment is a-right
It's worth all the years in the past
let's go one more night
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
no more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
no more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
no more
Goodnight my darlin'
another day has passed
Forget all those painful memories
our love's gonna last
Come to me baby come to me one more time
It's time we got movin' time to move on
Let's slide out the door let's slide out the door
Ride our way home let's glide our way home
Let's go let's go let's go let's go
let's go let's go I've come back for more
There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving
A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much
You started a fire
Inside of me
My burning hot body
Was a hundred and three
But lately I'm feeling
A drop in temperature
You're cooling down baby
And I'm begging for more
There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving
A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much
With you I was feeling
So secure
When I was down and had the blues
You had the cure
Now things are so different
But I believe I understand
I may be sharing your lips
With another man
Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving
A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much
A change in your loving
A change in your loving
Well I walked down to my bank just to see what I could see
I asked the man behind the desk I say "Ah is there any money for me"
Now he didn't know just what to say
I say "I need that money in a terrible way"
Now he didn't say "yeah" but he didn't say "no"
He just shook my hand and showed me the door
Oh Lord the blues is killin' me
Oh Lord Lord Lord these blues is killin' me
Yes sir
Now my wife loves money and it bothers my mind
She runs to the store and she buys on time
TV's radios stereos and I got all kind a princess phones
A one of these days ya'all-a I think they all gonna be gone
My baby need clothes my wife needs a car
It's a wonder ya'all ha I got this far Hey
Landlord knockin' and he wants some rent
Now I'm lookin' for the money that my wife just spent
Oh Lord um-hm the blues is killin' me
Oh Lord Lord Lord these blues is killin' me
Tellin' ya
Tax time ain't nothin' but a mess
Payin' Uncle Sam more an' I'm gettin' less
The po' stay po' and the rich stay rich
An' I'm right here in the middle
Now ain't that a
Barely gettin' by makes me mean
'Cause the politicians I'm payin' are livin' real clean
Step down Mister Politician and live like I do
I want you to know the workin' man blues
Oh Lord oh Lord these blues is killin' me
Oh Lord Lord Lord these blues is killin' me
Payin' these taxes worry me to death
Buyin' new TV's an' radios an' stereos
Baby needs clothes
Wife need a old car to get around in
Oh it's a bitch bein' po'
I say it's a ___ bein' po
Fading:
Now ain't that a bitch
Boy it's rough I'll tell ya
I've been tossing and turning all night
Staring into the darkness
Afraid to turn on the light
It's got nothing to do with money
I just sure enough want you honey
And I just can't rest
Till I get it right
'Cause when the morning breeze
Starts blowing
That's when you hear me call your name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious baby
End of the game
'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
You got me walking round in circles
Yeah I'm always pacing the floor
'Cause this life I'm living without you
I just can't take no more
When the morning breeze starts blowing
I can hear you call my name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious baby
End of the game
'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
'Cause when the morning breeze
Starts blowing
I can hear me call your name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious baby
End of the game
'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I always live by the golden rule
Whatever happens ha don't blow your cool
You gotta have nerves of steel
And never show folks how you honestly feel
I lived all my life this way ha
For example take yesterday:
I breeze home happy bringin' her my pay
Her note read so long savvy I haven't gone away
An' I threw myself down across our empty bed
An' this is what I said:
Ooo shhhhiiiii ooow ooow ooow
What Oh what are you gonna do with me
Ooo wow uh
But I was cool
So I "one for the roaded" at a all night bar
I wound up so loaded I tore up my car
The judge threw the book at me
An' when I read the sentence there I said:
"Oow Please oooow ooow please I got to know I got to know
What what went wrong
I don't underst I oh a
But I was cool
So I said she's the only one that I have to pay
And I found her an' pulled my gun an' fired point blank
The shot whistled right past that woman's head
An' I killed my hound dog dead
Oooooow ruff ruff rrr rrr rrr rur rur rur
As they carried me away
I was overheard to say
"Be cool be cool stay cool be cool"
My woman's been accusing me
Of stepping out
Jealous rumors have her mind filled
With so much doubt
And I've gotta convince her
I'm not doing her wrong
Before she leaves me
Sad and all alone
So when the clock hits five
I'll be gone
There's a matter
That I'm gonna settle later on
So if the boss man talks
About overtime
I'm just gonna smile
and pay him no mind
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
We'll go out to dinner
At our favorite restaurant
I'll hold her hand
And tell her she's all I'll ever want
When we get home
I'll take her straight to paradise
And we'll still be loving
Till the morning light
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
Now don't you start talking
About gossip or news
I'm warning you now
I'll put on my walking shoes
'Cause to me nothing in this world
Is a big deal
When it's compared to the way
She makes me feel all right
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
BB's got business tonight
We're gotta talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
You're breaking my heart baby
There ain't a damn thing I can do
You got me wringing my hands
And crying baby
While you're breaking my heart in two
You know I just can't believe
I can't believe baby
That you're doing the things you do
I can't believe baby
I can't believe you would do me wrong
Please have mercy on me baby
I want you to come on back
Come on back where you belong
I want you so bad
I want you so bad baby
You know I need my lady home
I used to be a big shot long ago
I had a Cadillac an' a whole lotta dough
Real fine women used to chase me down
Now not one-a those gals can be found
They're never home whenever I call
Don't seem to want me around at all
I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke
Stone-cold broke I ain't got a lousy dime
Went to a nightclub an' had my fun
Shuckin' an' jivin' wit'
ev'ryone
Drinkin' that beer an' gin an' wine
Boy I'm tellin' ya I had a good time
When I got home I didn't have no loot
Had to go down an' pawn my suit
I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke ha-ha
Stone-cold broke I ain't got a lousy dime
Now I'm a low-down dirty bum
Right back where I started from
I got no car I got no gal
I ain't even got a pal
Huffin' an' puffin' can't raise a cent
Put me out I can't pay my rent
I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke
Stone-cold broke I ain't got a lousy dime
Spoken:
"Damn I'm broke man I got no damn money"
"What n' the hell am I gonna do now"
"Oh hey Jim what's happenin' man"
"Oh man I'm sure glad to see you"
"Yeah I know I owe you twenty dollars man
but you know hey look it"
"Well you know they picked up my car up this mornin'"
"What" hm a-ha
"You know they say a man ain't suppose to cry"
"Man I'm gonna tell ya you know that they didn't lie"
"Ay I I I'm broke man I swear I'm broke"
"Ha I ain't had man I ain't got it I got about two dollars man that's it"
"Ha swear I'm broke man"
"Hm yeah yeah I'm broke yeah"
Fading:
"Trust me I'm broke man yeah I am"
I got the blues you know I'm so broke I wanna cry
Lord I got 'em you know I'm so broke I wanna cry
Because my baby she's gone and I just don't know the reason why

If you don't bend you'll have to break
It's good advise but a little too late
Nothin' but trouble everywhere I go yeah
What I've been through you never know
Got me down on my bendin' knee
Weepin' and bendin' like a willow tree
I'm not lyin' it's not a fake
You can tell by the look on my face
Just so much a man can take
Sooner or later he's gotta break

Weeping an' bendin' like a willow tree
Like a bitter pill that ya have to take
I'm beggin' you baby you say it's too late
For goodness sakes please give me a break
Just a little more that I can take
Got me down on my bendin' knee
Weepin' and bendin' like a willow tree
On the day I was born the nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder at the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up and she said leave this one alone
She could tell right away that I was bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad to the bone

There's a girl in the town calling my name
She says I put her down and I'm the one to blame
Well I broke her heart and left her here to cry
And I know that girl is telling me a lie
She says "I left and took back my ring
I don't remember a god-darn thing"
I used to like to run around
My reputation was going down
Spent my money like it was out of style
I wouldn't even give my gal a smile
She says "I left and took back my ring
I really don't remember a thing"
Amnesia amnesia amnesia
Baby what I do
Amnesia amnesia amnesia
Baby what I do
I used to like to run around
With every little girl in this town
Well I spent my money like it was out of style
I wouldn't even give my gal a smile
She says she wants me to come home
I wish the girl would just leave me alone
Amnesia amnesia amnesia
Baby what I do
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
My eyes was full of tears since she left me behind
I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet
I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet
My eyes are full of tears where can my baby be
I went to see a gypsy to get my fortune read
I went to see a gypsy to have my fortune read
My head hung in sorrow when she said what she said
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love
love won't give up on me
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love
love ain't gone 'n' give up on me
Every tear that I've cried
only washed away the fear inside
Now I I ain't gone 'n' give up on love
Every beat of my heart
pounds with joy and not with pain
Every beat of my heart
pounds with joy and not in vain
And although those are painful memories
only brought me to my knees
I was just given up on love
Little Johnny Taylor told us so long ago
What about the midnight cryin'
wo that cheatin' and lyin'
What about the price that will
oh surely be paid
Those that gave up on love
love will have it's day
I ain't givin' up on love
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love
love won't give up on me
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love
love won't give up on me
Every time I cry love just won't let me be
won't set me free
The late show is over
And the city is fast asleep
And I'm lost in a world
That's just too cold and deep
I've turned so many ways
I'm spinning like a top
I wish that I could get off
Or get this world to stop
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made
I'm always chasing dragons
With a sword that's made of tin
So I know in my soul
There's no way I can win
I tried oh I tried
But there's no place no place to go
There's no one here who knows me
And no one here I know
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made
My baby came home last night
And she looked at me real cool
She said "Albert you ain't nothin' but a overgrown fool
I'm gonna leave you gonna leave you behind"
I said " Baby I'm gonna tell you that a good fool is hard to find"
Now baby if you leave me it would hurt me to my soul
I just can't understand why baby any woman could be so cold
But a good fool a good fool is hard to find
Take a lesson from me baby a good fool is hard to find
The last time you left me I didn't have much to lose
You left me with nothin' woman but a pair of thin-sole shoe
But a good fool a good fool is hard to find
Take a lesson from me baby a good fool is hard to find
Now listen to me baby I think you should be told
When they made yo' daddy somebody went an' broke the mold
A good fool a good fool is hard to find
You take the lesson from me woman a good fool is hard to find
