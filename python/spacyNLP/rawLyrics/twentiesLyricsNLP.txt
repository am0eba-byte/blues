Loving is the thing I crave
For your love I'll be your slave
You gotta give me some yes give me some
Can't you hear me pleading you gotta give me some
Said mister Jones to old butcher Pete
I want a piece of your good old meat
You gotta give me some oh give me some
I crave your round steak you gotta give me some
Sweet as candy in a candy shop
Is just your sweet sweet lollipop
You gotta give me some please give me some
I love all day suckers you gotta give me some
To the milkman I heard Mary scream
Said she wanted a lots of cream
You gotta give me some oh give me some
Catch it when you come sir you gotta give me some
Hear my cryin' on my bended knees
If you wanna put my soul at ease
You gotta give me some please give me some
Can't stand it any longer you gotta give me some
Seeper called to Pele-Mele sugar lump
Said I'm going crazy about your hump
You've got to give me some please give me some
I can't wait eight days you gotta give me some
Jay bird said to the peckerwood
I like to peck like a pecker should
But give me some yes give me some
I'm crazy about them worms you've gotta give me some
Old pal old pal you stole my man away
Old pal old pal you stole my man away
But that's all right I'll get him back some day
You stole my man between midnight and day
You stole my man between midnight and day
Yes I bet you old pal I still will make you pay
Why should you have a daddy of your own
Why should you have a daddy of your own
Old pal old pal you better let my man alone
Now you says true friends should understand
Old pal you said true friends should understand
But that's no sign we should take each other's man
I worry all day I worry all night
Every time my man comes home he wants to fuss and fight
When I pick up the paper to read about the news
just as I'm satisfied yonder comes the blues
I went down to the river each and every day
Trying to keep from crying' and do my self away
I walked and walked till I wore out my shoes
I can't walk no further yonder comes the blues
Some folks never worry things all go all right
Or lay down on that sofa weep and cry all night
When I get a letter it never brings good news
Every time I see the mail babe yonder comes the blues
Go back blues don't come this way
Oughta give me something else beside the blues all day
Every man I love I've been refused
And when I want some loving yonder comes the blues
People have different blues and think their mighty bad
But blues that bother me are the worst I've ever had
I've been disgusted and all confused every time I look around yonder
come those blues
The blues the blues the yodling blues
They seem to haunt me all the time
Because that I ain't got no one
That will console my mind
It seems to me no happiness will I ever find
No happiness will I find
Lord lord lord lord
Lord lord lord lord
My man went out without a cause
I wonder who put them jinx
on me I said them jinx on me
I wonder who put them jinx on me lowdown jinx on me
My man's gone back to his used-to-be
I'm gonna yodel yodel my blues away I said my blues away
I'm gonna yodel yodel my blues away ee-ooo I'm gonna yodel
Till things come back my way
I've got the blues go spread the news
I've got those doggone yodling blues
The time has come for us to part
I ain't goin' to cry it won't break my heart
'Cause I'm through with you and I hope you don't feel hurt
You're a like an old horse shoe that's had its day
You're like an old shoe I must go away
I'm through with you and I hope you don't feel hurt
You're like an old ship that sprung a leak
You ain't young no more and your loving is weak
Now you know I'm through with you and I hope you don't feel hurt
You ain't got no money you are down and broke
You're just an old has-been like a worn-out joke
Say I'm through with you and I hope you don't feel hurt
I hear these women raving 'bout their monkey men
About their trifling husbands and their no good
friends
These poor women sit around all day and moan
Wondering why their wandering papa's don't come home
But wild women don't worry wild women don't have no blues
Now when you've got a man don't never be on the square
'Cause if you do he'll have a woman everywhere
I never was known to treat no one man right
I keep 'em working hard both day and night
'Cause wild women don't worry wild women don't have their blues
I've got a disposition and a way of my own
When my man starts kicking I let him find another home
I get full of good liquor walk the streets all night
Go home and put my man out if he don't act right
Wild women don't worry wild women don't have their blues
You never get nothing by being an angel child
You better change your ways and get real wild
I wanna tell you something I wouldn't tell you a lie
Wild women are the only kind that really get by
'Cause wild women don't worry wild women don't have their blues
Tillie Brown was a dancing fool
Spent her time in a dancing school
When the band would play
Tillie would start right in to sway
First one out on the ballroom floor
She never got enough she just craved for more
When she start to sway
All the girls and boys would say
Whoa Tillie take your time
Whoa Tillie take your time
There ain't no use to hurrying 'cause you wanna prance
You've got all night to do that dance
Whoa Tillie lay 'em down
Whoa Tillie Brown
You don't know what to shake
When you shake
What to break
Whoa Tillie take your time
Whoa Tillie take your time
Whoa Tillie take your time
There ain't no use to hurrying 'cause you wanna prance
Look out there Tillie you got all night to do that dance
Whoa Tillie lay 'em down
Whoa Tillie Tillie Brown
You don't know what to shake
When you shake
What to break
Whoa Tillie take your time
Woke up this morning up this morning
With my head bowed down hey hey hey
Woke up this morning with my head bowed down
I had that mean old feeling I was in the wrong man's town
Mailman's been here mailman's been here
But didn't leave no news hey hey hey
Mailman's been here but didn't leave no news
That's the reason why mama's got the walking blues
Walked and walked till I walked and walked
I almost lost my mind hey hey hey
Walked and walked till I almost lost my mind
I was afraid to stop walking 'cause I might lose some time
Got a short time to make it short time to make it
And a long ways to go Lord Lord Lord
Short time to make it and a long way to go
Trying to find the town they call San Antonio
Thought I'd rest me thought I'd rest me
I couldn't hear no news Lord Lord Lord
Thought I'd rest me I couldn't hear no news
I'll soon be there 'cause I got the walking blues

Passing by the jail this morn'
Heard a hard luck brother mourn
I'm in here right where I don't belong
I never did no wrong
As I passed by his window
I could hear him moaning his song
Sitting on the inside looking at the outside
Waitin' for that evenin' mail
Four walls and a ceiling
Lordy what a feeling
Just the mean old lowdown jail
Separating me from everything but that evenin' mail
I wrote my onetime baby down in Jacksonville
Hey sweet baby I'm in jail
Baby please don't fail me
Hurry up and mail me bail
That's just a year ago today and I'm
Still on the inside looking at the outside
Waitin' for that evenin' mail
And I'm still on the inside looking at the outside
Waitin' for that evenin' mail
I have sent a letter away 'cause my man and I don't agree
There's no reason why he should treat me this way
'Cause the way I worry I will soon be old and grey
Don't want to do nothing that's wrong
But can't stand this treatment long
I just lay and suffer crying sighing all night long
'Cause the way that I'm worried Lordy it sure is wrong
All night long all night long
It's this one man on my mind
Can't sleep a wink at night from crying
All night long got my worries just renewed
And I suffer with those all night blues
Did you ever sit thinking with a thousand things on your mind
Did you ever sit thinking with a thousand things on your mind
Thinking about someone who has treated you so nice and kind
You'll get an old letter and you begin to read
You'll get an old letter and you begin to read
Got the blues so bad tell that man of mine I wanna be
Don't you hear me baby knocking on your door
Don't you hear me baby knocking on your door
Have you got the nerve to drive me from your door
Have you got the nerve to say that you don't want me no more
Have you got the nerve to say that you don't want me no more
The good book said you got to reap what you sow
Take me back baby try me one more time
Take me back baby try me one more time
That's the only way I can get these thinking blues off my mind
Worried in the nighttime worried in the day
'Cause another sweetie took my man away
Down in St Louis there I lost my pride and joy
St Louis woman stole the heart of my big boy I'm cryin'
St Louis gal just look what you done done I said what you done done
St Louis gal you gonna have some fun I mean a-lots of fun
I'm always cryin' the blues both night and day
Now daddy's gone but you will shake in your shoes
Hear what I say 'cause some fine mornin' without any warnin'
St Louis gal I'm gonna handle you I say manhandle you
You'll find yourself in a jam as sure as anything what am
Down in Missouri there'll come a time your life won't be worth a dime
You stole my pal St Louis gal I'm going a-huntin' do do de do
You know just what I'm gonna do you stole my pal St Louis gal
I hate to see the ev'nin' sun go down
Hate to see the ev'nin' sun go down
'cause my baby he done left this town
Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
Feel tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my trunk make my getaway
St Louis woman with her diamond rings
Pulls that man 'round by her apron strings
't'want for powder and for store-bought hair
The man I love would not gone nowhere
got the St Louis blues just as blue as I can be
That man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me
Been to the gypsy to get my fortune told
To the gypsy to get my fortune told
'cause I'm most wild about my jelly roll
Gypsy done told me "Don't you wear no black"
Yes she done told me "Don't you wear no black
go to St Louis you can win him back"
Help me to Cairo make St Louis by myself
Gone to Cairo find my old friend Jeff
Goin' to pin myself close to his side
if I flag his train I sure can ride
I love that man like a schoolboy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky Colonel loves his mint and rye
I'll love my baby till the day I die
You ought to see that stovepipe brown of mine
like he owns the diamond Joseph line
He'd make across-eyed old man go stone blind
Blacker than midnight teeth like flags of truce
Blackest man in the whole St Louis
Blacker the berry sweeter is the juice
About a crap game he knows a powerful lot
but when work time comes he's on the dot
Goin' to ask him for a cold ten spot
what it takes to get it he's certainly got
A black-headed gal make a freight train jump the track
Said a black-headed gal make a freight train jump the track
But a redheaded woman makes a preacher
ball the jack
House catch on fire and ain't no water 'round
If your house catch on fire ain't no water 'round
Throw your trunk out the window building burn on down
I went to that gypsy to have my fortune told
I went to that gypsy to have my fortune told
He said "Doggone you girlie doggone your bad luck soul"
I turned around went to that gypsy next door
I turned around went to that gypsy next door
He said "You'll get a man anywhere you'll go"
Let me be your rag doll until your Chinee comes
Let me be your rag doll till your Chinee comes
If she beats me ragging she's got to rag it some
Oh the gale is raging and my ship's without a sail
Oh the gale is raging and my ship's without a sail
If the wind keeps on a-blowing I won't be left to tell the tale
Oh the ship is sinking and the lightning struck the mast
Now the ship is sinking and the lightning struck the mast
And my crew is done deserted I've got to stick here to the last
Oh I don't mind drowning but the water is so cold
No I don't mind drowning but the water is so cold
If I must leave this good world I wanna leave it brave and bold
Mama's shipwrecked shipwrecked she ain't got no time to lose
Mama's shipwrecked shipwrecked she ain't got no time to lose
Lord if someone don't save me I'll go down singing the shipwrecked
blues
Every Monday mornin' people just a worry full day
Every Monday mornin' people just a worry full day
I think about my daddy who's many miles away
Every Tuesday mornin' whiskey is all I crave
Every Tuesday mornin' whiskey is all I crave
The blues and booze are goin' to carry me to my grave
Wednesdays and Thursdays I try to wear the blues away
Wednesdays and Thursdays I try to wear the blues away
But when you get 'em about your daddy they really come to stay
Every Friday people is always my bad luck day
Every Friday people is always my bad luck day
That's the day my man packed up and went away
I woke up Saturday mornin' tryin' to find my man
I woke up Saturday mornin' tryin' to find my man
I ain't got nobody to lend me a helpin' hand
Spoken:
Who's that knockin' on that door
Jones
You better get away from that door
I don't know nobody named Jones
You're in the right church brother but the wrong pew
Sam Jones left his lawful wife just to step around
Came back home 'bout a year
Took it for his high brown
Went to his accustomed shore
And he knocked his knuckles sore
His wife she came but to his shame
She knew his face no more
Sam said "I'm your husband dear"
But she said "Dear that's strange to hear"
You ain't talkin' to Mrs Jones
You speakin' to Miss Wilson now
I used to be your lawful mate
But the judge done changed my fate
Was a time you could-a' walked right in
And call this place your home sweet home
But now it's all mine for all time
I'm free and livin' all alone
Don't need your clothes don't need your rent
Don't need your ones and twos
Though I ain't rich I know my stitch
I earned my strutting
shoes
Say hand me the key that unlocks my front door
Because that bell don't read Sam Jones no more no
You ain't talkin' to Mrs Jones
You speakin' to Miss Wilson now
When I wasn't nothin' but a child
When I wasn't nothin' but a child
All you men tried to drive me wild
Now I'm growin' old
Now I'm growin' old
and I've got what it takes to get all of you men told
My mama says I'm reckless my daddy says I'm wild
My mama says I'm reckless my daddy says I'm wild
I ain't good lookin' but I'm somebody's angel child
Daddy mama wants some lovin'
Daddy mama wants some huggin'
Darn it pretty papa mama wants some lovin' I vow
Darn pretty papa mama wants some lovin' right now
Early this morning the blues came walking in my room
Early this morning the blues came walking in my room
I said "Blues please tell me what you are doing here so soon"
The looked at me and smiled but yet they refused to say
The looked at me and smiled but yet they refused to say
Asked the again the they turned and walked away
Blues oh blues you know you've been here before
Blues oh blues you know you've been here before
The last time you were here you made me cry and walk the floor
I had a man for fifteen years
Give him his room and board
Once he was like a Cadillac
Now he's like an old worn out Ford
He never brought me a lousy dime
And put it in my hand
So there'll be some changes from now on
According to my plan
He's got to get it bring it and put it right here
Or else he's gonna keep it out there
If he must steal it beg it or borrow it somewhere
Long as he gets it I don't care
I'm tired of fryin' pork chops
To grease his fat lips
And he has to find another place
For to park his old hips
He must get it and bring it and put it right here
Or else he's gonna keep it out there
The bee gets the honey and brings it to the corn
Else he's kicked out of his home sweet home
To show you that they brings it watch the dog and the cat
Everything even brings it from a mule to a gnat
The rooster gets the worm and brings it to the hen
That oughta be a tip to all you no-good men
The groundhog even brings it and puts it in his hole
So my man has got to bring it doggone
his soul
He's got to get it bring it and put it right here
Or else he's gonna keep it out there
If he must steal it beg it or borr' it somewhere
Long as he gets it child I don't care
I'm gonna tell him like the China man: when you don't bring 'em check
You don't get 'em laundry if you break 'em down neck
You got to get it bring it and put it right here
Or else you gonna keep it out there
All day long I'm worried all night long I'm blue
I'm so awfully lonesome I don't know what to do
So I ask you doctor see if you can't find
Something in your satchel to satisfy my mind
Doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
The wearied blues
Let me tell you doctor why I'm in misery
Once I had a lover he went away from me
Sent to see the gypsy voodoo
doctors too
Shook their heads and told me nothing they could do
Doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
The mean old blues
Like a little baby all day long I cry
And if you can't cure me I just am sure to die
Give me something poison doctor won't you please
Then I'll sign a paper: died with the heart's disease
Doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
The plain old blues
Girls I wanna tell you about these sweet men
These men goin' around here tryin' to play cute
I'm hard on you boys yes sir
I fell in love with a sweet man once
He said he loved me too
He said if I'd run away with him
What nice things he would do
I'd travel around from town to town
How happy I would feel
But don't you know he would not work
Girls take this tip from me
Get a working man when you marry
And let all these sweet men be
Child it takes money to run a business
And with me I know you girls will agree
There's one thing about this married life
That these young girls have got to know
Say if a sweet man enter your front gate
Turn out your light and lock your door
Yes get a working man when you marry
Let all these pinchbacks be
Child it takes money to run a business
And with me I know you girls will agree
And if this panic stays on much longer
I'll hear all these young girls say
That it's a long way to Oklahoma
But these little pinchbacks take them away
I've got the meanest man in the land
But his love is that sticking brand
His kiss just lingers on my lips
And thrill me to my fingertips
People say I'm a fool
He's heartless and also cruel
But outside of that he's all right with me
Outside of that he's sweet as he can be
I love him as true as stars above
He beats me up but how he can love
I never loved like that since the day I was born
I said for fun I don't want you no more
And when I said that I made sweet papa sore
He blacked my eyes I couldn't see
Then he pawned the things he gave to me
But outside of that he's all right with me
I said for fun I don't want you no more
And when I said that I made sweet papa sore
When he pawned my things I said: you're a dirty old thief
Now then he turned around and knocks out both of my teeth
Outside of that he's all right with me
In a bakery shop today
I heard Miss Mandy Jenkins say
She had the best cake you see
And they were fresh as fresh could be
And as the people would pass by
You would hear Miss Mandy cry
Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine like mine
No other one in town can bake a sweet jelly roll so fine so fine
It's worth lots of dough the boys tell me so
It's fresh every day you'll hear 'em all say
Don't be no dunce just try it once
You'll be right in line
Somebody told me I made the best jelly roll in town I say in town
You must admit that I'm a jelly roll bakin' hound bakin' hound
Good jelly roll jelly roll is so hard to find
We always get the other kind
Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine
Somebody told me I made the best jelly roll in town I say in town
You must admit that I'm a jelly roll bakin' hound bakin' hound
Good jelly roll jelly roll from a bakery shop
Will surely make a pool frog hop
Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine like mine
I've got a lovesick tale to tell to you
Though it ain't no affair of mine
It's 'bout a gal named Sue and a boy named Lou
They were fighting all the time
Sue came home one afternoon
And found an empty dining room
Without a word her turtledove had flown
She began to moan
My sweetie went away but he didn't say where
He didn't say when he didn't say why
Oh bid me goodbye
I'm blue as I can be
I know he loved another one but he didn't say who
He didn't say when he didn't say what
His mama has got
That took my sweetie from me
I'm like a little lost sheep
And I can't sleep
But I keep trying to forget
My trifling papa has left his mama all alone I groan
My sweetie went away but he didn't say where
He didn't say when he didn't say why
I know I'll die
Why don't he hurry home
Clara: who was that man I saw you with the other day
Bessie: that was my smooth black daddy that we call Charlie Gray
Don't you know that's my man
Yes that's a fact
I ain't seen your name printed up and down his back
You better let him be
What old gal
Because you ain't talkin' to me
That's my man I want him for my own
spoken: No No
He's my sweet daddy
You'd better leave that man alone
See that suit he's got on

- Hold him Luke he must be a bootlegger -
I've been drinking all night babe and the night before
But when I get sober I ain't gonna drink no more
'Cause my friend's left me standing in my door
My head goes round and around babe since my baby left town
I don't know if the river's running up or down
But that one thing certain is mama's going to leave town
You'll find me reeling and a-rocking howling like a hound
Catch the first train that's running Southbound
Oh stop you'll hear me saying
Stop right through my brain
Oh stop that train
So I can ride back home again
Here I'm upon my knees
Play that again for me
'Cause I'm about to be a-losing my mind
Boys I can't stand up I can't sit down
The man I love has done left town
I feel like screaming I feel like crying Lord
I've been mistreated folks and don't mind I'm dying
I'm going home I'm going to settle down
I'm going to stop my running around
Tell everybody that comes my way
I've got those moonshine
blues I say
I've got those moonshine blues
Daddy mama's got the blues
The kind of blues that's hard to lose
'Cause you mistreated me
And drove me from your door
Daddy you ain't heard the news
There's another papa in your shoes
You ain't even got a chance with me no more
So be on your p's and q's
Mistreating daddy mistreating mama all the time
Just because she wouldn't let you
Mistreating daddy mama's drawed the danger line
Yes you'll cross it I'll get you
If you see me setting on another daddy's knee
Don't bother me I'm as mean as can be
I'm like the butcher right down the street
I can cut you all apieces like I would a piece of meat
Mistreating daddy you used to knock your mama down
When you knew I fell for you
Had me so nervous I would start dogging 'round
Yes every time I saw you
But now I've got you off of my mind
And found another daddy who's just my kind
Mistreating daddy I've got another papa now
I've got a tip for people talking about
I will grab my daddy and turn him wrong side out
Mistreating daddy I've got a good papa now
Love me daddy love me all the time
Love me until I pass away
I'm just wild about my loving
Love me night and day
I used to have an old man who never did like loving
That man was not my kind
I found someone who likes loving like me
And you can pass my house and hear me crying
I want a man to be real nice to me and call me mama I say mama
I don't want no man if he can't call me mama I say mama
He's got to be nice and kind
Got to love me all the time
And when he starts loving all you can hear me saying
Oh papa please your mama
Lord I want a man I can play with all night long
I want a man to take back round to my mama's home
And when he loves me in that oldfashioned way
I don't mind dying everyday
Because lovin' lovin' is the thing I'm just wild about
I want a man that I can play with all night long
I want a man to take back round to my mama's home
And when he loves me in that oldfashioned way
I don't mind dying every day
Because lovin' lovin' is the thing I'm just wild about
Minutes seem like hours hours seem like days
Minutes seem like hours hours seem like days
It seems like my daddy won't stop his evil ways
Seems like every minute's going to be my last
Seems like every minute's going to be my last
If I can't tell my future I won't tell my past
The brook runs into the river river runs into the sea
The brook runs into the river river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my daddy somebody ought to bury me
If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song
If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song
Tell 'em you don't know the writer but Ma Rainey put it on
Bad luck has come to stay
Trouble never end
My man has gone away
With a girl I thought was my friend
I'm worried down with care
Lordy can't you hear my prayer
Lady Luck Lady Luck
Won't you please smile down on me
There's the time friend of mine
I need your sympathy
I've got a horseshoe on my door
I've knocked on wood till my hands are sore
Since my man's done turned me loose
I've got those Lady Luck blues I mean
I've got those Lady Luck blues
Lady Luck Lady Luck
Won't you please smile down on me
There's the time friend of mine
I need your sympathy
I've got his picture turned upside down
I've sprinkled goofer dust all around
Since my man is gone I'm all confused
I've got those Lady Luck blues
Find my good man
I've got those Lady Luck blues
One dark and stormy night Bill Jones was feeling blue
Things didn't seem just right so he didn't know just what to do
I said: Bill please tell me ain't you satisfied
He looked around so pitiful then to me he replied
Keeps on a-rainin' look how it's rainin'
Papa he can't make no time
Wind keeps blowing cold wind blowing
Soon I'll find a southern clime
In the wintertime when it starts to snow
You know you pretty mama's got to have some dough
Keeps on rainin' look how it's rainin'
Papa he can't make no time
Ain't the snow just beautiful some people say
But I'd rather see it in a moving picture play
Keeps on snowin' look how it's snowin'
Papa he can't make no time
Lord this house is goin' to get raided yes sir
Thirty days in jail with my back turned to the wall to the wall
Thirty days in jail with my back turned to the wall
Look here mister jail keeper put another gal in my stall
I don't mind being in jail but I got to stay there so long so long
I don't mind being in jail but I got to stay there so long so long
Well every friend I had is done shook hands and gone
You better stop your man from ticklin' me under my chin under my chin
You better stop your man from ticklin' me under my chin
'Cause if he keeps on ticklin' I'm sure gonna take him on in
Good morning blues blues how do you do how do you do
Good morning blues blues how do you do
Well I just come here to have a few words with you
Daddy I want some furs and things
Daddy I want the diamond rings
Aeroplanes motor cars and such
If your little mama ain't askin' too much
From you from you
Won't you give me what I want daddy do
If you don't I know who will
If you don't I know who will
You may think that I'm just bluffin'
But I'm one gal ain't supposed to want for nothin'
I got my wantin' habits on
I've had 'em on since this morn
Man you've got to help me 'long
If you don't it's good-bye John
Squeeze me till I feel the thrill
Love me till I get my fill
'Cause if you don't and say you won't
I know who will Mr So-and-So
I know who will
If you don't I know who will
If you don't I know who will
You might think that I'm just bluffin'
But I'm one gal ain't supposed to want for nothin'
I've got my wantin' habits on
I've had 'em on since this morn
Man you've got to help me 'long
If you don't it's goodbye John
Squeeze me till I feel the thrill
Love me till I get my fill
'Cause if you don't and say you won't
I know who will my other papa
I know who will
Tell me pretty daddy what's the matter now
Tell me pretty daddy what's the matter now
Aw you're trying to quit me and you don't know how
I'd rather be dead buried in the sea
I'd rather be dead buried in the sea
Than have the man I love say he don't want me
Lawd Lawd Lawd Lawd Lawd Lawd
Lawd Lawd Lawdy Lawdy Lawd
Oh the man I love treats me like a dog
I'd rather see my coffin come rolling in my door
I'd rather see my coffin come rolling in my door
Than hear the man I love say "I don't want you no more"
You want to say goodbye
No need to tell me why
Now that our little romance is through
All I can say is: good luck to you
Don't waste your tears on me
I don't need sympathy
Just go ahead about your business
Sweet daddy let your mama be
I never miss the sunshine I am so used to the rain
And when you're gone I won't feel bad
I never miss the things that I never had
Although I hate to lose you but I won't complain
You said you want to leave me there's the door
I've been disappointed many times before
I never miss the sunshine I'm so used to the rain
I'm going upon the mountain to watch the sinking sun
Ain't found nobody else could love me like my loving daddy done
Oh I never miss the sunshine I'm so used to the rain
Clara: I feel sad
Bessie: You feel blue
Clara: I can hardly sleep at night
Bessie: For your man was sore all the time
Clara: And I know I didn't treat him right
Bessie: You're going back to your first love
Clara: 'Cause a good man is hard to find
Bessie: I say you'll have such a grand good man
Clara: Believe me he is sure on my mind
Clara: I'm going back
Bessie: Yeah you carrying it on back
Clara: I'm going back to my used to be
Bessie: You're going back
Clara: I'm going back 'cause my man was sure good to me
When last winter when times was rough
Bessie: Look out there Clara
Clara: You know your man was in the pool yard strutting his stuff
I'm going back
Bessie: Clara you say you're going back
I'm going back to my used to be
Bessie: And it's this morning
Clara: Back to my used to be
Bessie: What can you use him for
Clara: Crazy about my used to be
Bessie: He ain't good-looking
Clara: I love my used to be
There's a saying going 'round and I begin to think it's true
It's awful hard to love someone when they don't care 'bout you
Once I had a lovin' man as good as many in this town
But now I'm sad and lonely for he's gone and turned me down now
I ain't got nobody and nobody cares for me
I got the blues the weary blues
And I'm sad and lonely won't somebody come and take a chance with me
I'll sing sweet love songs honey all the time
If you'll come and be my sweet baby mine
'Cause I ain't got nobody and nobody cares for me
Won't somebody go and find my man and bring him back to me
It's awful hard to be alone and without sympathy
Once I was a loving gal as good as any in this town
but since my daddy left me I'm a gal with her heart bowed down
Don't bring no ghosts in the front hurry 'em round to the backdoor
This house is so haunted with dead men I can't lose
This house is so haunted with dead men I can't lose
And a sneaky old feeling gives me those haunted house blues
I can't sleep no more I done lost my appetite
I can't sleep no more done lost my appetite
'Cause my mistreating daddy hangs around me day and night
He moans when I'm sleeping he wakes me at am
He moans when I'm sleeping he wakes me at am
And he makes me swear I'll have no other man but him
Now I'm so worried and I'm blue all the time
Now I'm so worried and I'm blue all the time
Go tell the undertaker to fix that old coffin of mine
Lord help us to get right
I'm scared to stay here I'm scared to leave this town
I'm scared to stay here I'm scared to leave this town
But a feeling just tells me to burn this house on down
Tear this house on down
I've been blue all day my man's gone away
He has left his mama cold for another gal I'm told
I tried to treat him kind I thought he would be mine
That man I hate to lose that's why mama's got the blues
The man I love he has done left this town
The man I love he has done left this town
And if it keeps on snowing I will be Gulf Coast bound
The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news
The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news
I'll tell the world he left me with those Gulf Coast blues
Some of you men sure do make me tired
Some of you men sure do make me tired
You've got a mouthful of "gimme" a handful of "much oblige"
Blues on my mind blues all around my bed
Blues on my mind blues all around my bed
Had a dream last night the man I love was dead
I went to the graveyard fell down on my knees
I went to the graveyard fell down on my knees
I asked the gravedigger to give me back my good man please
The gravedigger looked me in my eye
The gravedigger looked me in my eye
Said "Sorry for you lady your man's said his last goodbye"
Give me a break papa don't throw your sweet mama down
Give me a break papa don't throw your sweet mama down
You treated me so mean ain't you tired of doggin' me 'round
There was a time when nobody wanted you but me
There was a time when nobody wanted you but me
You didn't have no friends you were poor and hungry as could be
I took you up and fed you give you a nice home too
I took you up and fed you give you a nice home too
That's why I can't understand why you treat me dirty like you do
Now I'm sad and lonely feel mistreated and blue
Now I'm sad and lonely feel mistreated and blue
Won't you give me a break papa like I gave you
How come I'm blue as can be how come I need sympathy
I know what's troubling me listen and you'll see
Because the good man that I got left me all alone
Woke up this morning at four when I heard him slamming my door
Did you ever wake up on a frosty morning and discover your good man gone
Did you ever wake up on a frosty morning and discover your good man gone
If you did you'll understand why I'm singing sad moanful songs
Well he didn't provide and he wasn't handsome so he might not appeal to you
Well he didn't provide and he wasn't handsome so he might not appeal to you
But he gave me plenty loving and I never had to beg him too
Now my damper is down and my fire ain't burning and a
chill's all around my bed
My damper is down and my fire ain't burning and a chill's all around my bed
When you lose the man you love then a gal is just as good as dead
Why do people believe in some old sign
Why do people believe in some old sign
To hear a hoot owl holler someone is surely dyin'
Some will break a mirror cry bad luck for seven years
Some will break a mirror cry bad luck for seven years
And if a black cat crosses them they'll break right down in tears
To dream of muddy water trouble is knockin' at your door
To dream of muddy water trouble is knockin' at your door
Your man is sure to leave you and never return no more
When your man come home evil tell you you are getting old
When your man come home evil tell you you are getting old
That's a true sign he's got someone else bakin' his jelly roll
I heard the folks were talking here yesterday
As I listened by the door
Would eavesdrop 'cause they never hear no good they
say
And I heard things that hurt me so
They said I had a man I give my money to
They said I had a man I give my money to
And if I was broke he would turn my eyes all blue
They talked about my pa who was blind in one eye
They talked about my pa who was blind in one eye
They said he was a sinner and was too mean to cry
I never knock nobody wonder why they picked on me
I never knock nobody wonder why they picked on me
There's goin' to be a funeral if they don't let me be
I never stopped to listen to try and hear no good news
I never stopped to listen to try and hear no good news
I hear things about me give me those eavesdropper's blues
Gee but it's hard to love someone when that someone don't love you
I'm so disgusted heartbroken too
I've got those down hearted blues
Once I was crazy 'bout a man
He mistreated me all the time
The next man I get he's got to promise to be mine all mine
If I could only find the man oh how happy I would be
To the good Lord ev'ry night I pray
Please send my man back to me
I've almost worried myself to death wond'ring why he went away
But just wait and see he's gonna want me back some sweet day
Trouble trouble I've had it all my days
Trouble trouble I've had it all my days
It seems that trouble's going to follow me to my grave
Got the world in a jug the stopper's in my hand
Got the world in a jug
The stopper's in my hand
Going to hold it baby till you come under my command
Say I ain't never loved but three men in my life
No I ain't never loved but three men in my life
'T'was my father brother and the man who wrecked my life
'Cause he mistreated me and he drove me from his door
Yeah he mistreated me and he drove me from his door
But the good book says you'll reap just what you sow
Oh it may be a week and it may be a month or two
Yes it may be a week and it may be a month or two
But the day you quit me honey it's coming home to you
Oh I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried
Yes I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried
Had the down hearted blues and couldn't be satisfied
Sadie Brown and Linda Lee
Were as good a pair as could be
Till Sadie tried a brand new man
Start telling 'bout his good quality
How he could love pet and tease
How the things he did would please
One night her good man give her the air
Sadie cried out loud right then and there
Don't never tell nobody what your perfect good man can do
You just get them anxious to try some of his good points too
If he's nice and sweet and hard to beat
Don't tell your bestest friend
They'll never rest without a test
You know that there is always better than best
He may really try to be good and true
But if you want to keep him it is up to you
Do never tell nobody what your perfect good man can do
My daddy come home this mornin' drunk as he could be
My daddy come home this mornin' drunk as he could be
I know that he's done got bad on me
He used to stay out late now he don't come home at all
He used to stay out late now he don't come home at all
I know there's another mule been kicking in my stable
If you don't like my ocean don't fish in my sea
If you don't like my ocean don't fish in my sea
Stay out of my valley let my mountain be
I ain't had no loving since God knows when
I ain't had no loving since God knows when
That's the reason I'm through with these no-good trifling men
You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall
You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall
You'll never miss your ham till another mule be in your stall
It's a long long lane that has no turning
And it's a fire that always keeps on burning

Everytime he kisses me that funny feeling creeps up my back

I don't want no man to put no sugar in my tea
I don't want no man to put no sugar in my tea
Some of them's so evil I'm afraid they might poison me
I went downtown and bought me a hat
I brought it back home I laid it on the shelf
Looked at my bed I'm getting tired of sleeping by myself
Went to bed last night and boy I was in my sleep sleep
I went to bed last night and I was in my sleep
Woke up this mornin' the police was shakin' me
I went to the jailhouse drunk and blues as I could be
I went to the jailhouse drunk and blues as I could be
But that cruel old judge sent my man away from me
They carried me to the courthouse Lordy how I was cryin'
They carried me to the courthouse Lordy how I was cryin'
They jailed me sixty days in jail and money couldn't pay my fine
Sixty days ain't long if you can spend them as you choose
Sixty days ain't long if you can spend them as you choose
But this seems like jail than a cell where there ain't no booze
My life is all a misery when I cannot get my booze
My life is all a misery when I cannot get my booze
I spend every dime on liquor got to have the booze to go with these
blues
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but your lover on your mind
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but your lover on your mind
The man that keeps you worried and always cryin'
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman wanting to see her man
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman wanting to see her man
She can't get when she want him gotta catch him when she can
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a slow achin' heart disease
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a slow achin' heart disease
Just like consumption it kills you by degrees
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a woman that cries night and day
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a woman that cries night and day
Cryin' about her lover another woman took him away
Oh papa papa papa mama done gone mad
Oh papa papa papa mama done gone mad
Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman feelin' bad
When you're sad and lonely
Thinking about you only
Feeling disgusted and blue
Ah your heart is aching
Yes it's almost breaking
No one to tell your troubles to
That's the time you'll hang your head
And begin to cry
All your friends forsake you
Trouble overtakes you
And your good man turns you down
Evil talk about you
Everybody doubt you
And your friends can't be found
Not a soul to ease your pain
You will plead in vain
You've got those bleeding hearted blues
Say baby tell me what's on your mind
Pretty papa tell me what's on your mind
You keep my poor heart achin'
I'm worried all the time

I give up my mother
I even give up dear old dad
Minnie Neal down in Beale gave her papa the air

Poor Joe her beau looked just like he would die
If you were near him you would hear him start his mournful cry

Sometimes I was cruel that was true
But papa you know mama never two-times you
Ooh-ooh I'm blue
So how come you do me like you do I'm crying

But not the kind you serve to me
So Beale Street papa come back home
So how come you do me like you do I'm crying
Beale Street papa don't mess around with me
There's plenty of petting that I can get in Tennessee

Even no place I can call my home
That is why you always hear me moan
Mmmmmmm
Mmmmmmm
How my heart ache soon it will break
I'm almost through what will I do Lord
Just to cure these awful moanin' blues
My man ain't acting right

But still he says he loves no one but me
But if I find the gal
That's trying to steal my pal
I'll get her told just you wait and see
I feel so blue don't know what to do
Every woman in my place is bound to feel blue too
Lord I love my man better than I love myself
I love my man better than I love myself
And if he don't have me he sure won't have nobody else
My man's got teeth like a lighthouse in the sea
My man's got teeth like a lighthouse in the sea
And every time he smiles he throws his light on me
His voice sounds like chimes I mean the organ kind
His voice sounds like chimes I mean the organ kind
And every time he speaks it's music to my troubled mind

Gonna kill somebody if they don't let my man alone

Caught you with your good-time tramp

I know a triflin' man they call him Triflin'
Sam
He lives in Birmingham way down in Alabam'
Then the other night he had a fight
with a gal named Mandy Brown
She plainly stated he was aggravating
as she shouted out to him
Aggravatin' papa don't you try to two-time me
I said don't two-time me
Aggravatin' papa treat me kind or let me be
I mean just let me be
Listen while I get you told
Stop messin' round sweet jelly roll
If you stay out with a high-brown baby
I'll smack you down and I don't mean maybe
Aggravatin' papa I'll do anything you say
Anything you say
But when you go struttin' do you strut around my way so papa
Just treat me pretty be nice and kind
The way you're treating me will make me lose my mind
Aggravatin' papa don't you try to two-time me
Just treat me pretty be nice and sweet
I got a darn forty-four
that don't repeat
Aggravatin' papa don't you try to two-time me
Now won't you listen dearie while I say
how could you tell me that you're goin' away
Don't say that we must part don't break my aching heart
You know I've loved you truly many years loved you night and day
How can you leave me can't you see my tears
Listen while I say
After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone there's no denying
You'll feel blue you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had
There'll come a time now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Some day when you grow lonely
You heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone after you've gone away
After I'm gone after we break up
After I'm gone you're gonna wake up
You will find you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind
After the years we've been together
Their joy and tears all kinds of weather
Someday blue and downhearted
You'll long to be with me right back where you started
After I'm gone after I'm gone away
Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you
Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you
You can see that my grave is kept clean
And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground
Did you ever hear that coffin' sound
Have you ever heard that coffin' sound
Did you ever hear that coffin' sound
Means another poor boy is under ground
Did you ever hear them church bells tone
Have you ever hear'd them church bells tone
Did you ever hear them church bells tone
Means another poor boy is dead and gone
Well my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
Well my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
Now I believe what the bible told
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean
