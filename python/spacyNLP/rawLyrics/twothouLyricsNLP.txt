On the Cupid doll

He's gonna check us all out of here
Up to the mansion on the hill
Where you can get your booze strips and pills

With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a hot tomato road
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
And I'm gonna play this thing until the day I die

That money can buy
But still I'm so unhappy
That I could cry
Because I've never
Had peace of mind
People in my lifetime
When you're in trouble
And all down and out
Then you'll find out
What it's all about
Then you'll realize
That peace of mind
Darling is hard to find
I've been everywhere
Seen everything
But I only have myself to blame
For not realizing while
I was riding high
That happiness is something
Money can't buy

And good luck too

Had peace of mind

I've got the key to the highway
Feel I got to go
Gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow
I'm going back to the border
Baby where I'm better known
Because you haven't done nothing baby
But draw the good man from home
When the moon peeps over the mountain
Little girl I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roll the highway until the break of day
Oh give me one more kiss darling
Just before I go
'Cause when I leave this time little girl
I won't be back no more
I've got the key to the highway
Little darling I got to go
I'm gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow
People Got Money
Still Got problems
Got to the doctor
And try to solve them
Anyway you look at it
It's still called the blues
Baby needs new shoes
Mama needs a new dress
Daddy's out scufflin'
Tryin' to do his best
Anyway you look at it
It's still called the blues
Makes no difference
What you do or say
The blues might still
Come your way
Just when you think
Your trouble's about to end
Along comes something
And start it all over again
You party on a Saturday
Go to church on Sunday
Fun leaves you because
Gotta work on Monday
Anyway you look at it
It's still called the blues
Makes no difference
What you do or say
The blues might still
Come your way
Just when you think
Your trouble's about to end
Along comes something
And start it all over again
Ain't got no money
To pay the rent
Baby's gone
You spent your last cent
Mm still called the blues
Still called the blues y'all
Anyway you look at it
Makes no difference
What you do or say
The blues might still
Come your way
Just when you think
Your trouble's about to end
Along comes something
And start it all over again
I wonder helplessly day by day
It's so much easier to run away
My mind is telling my body so
Never know which way to go
I'm always there for you baby
You let me see
If we can get closer everyday
I wanna be
Held by you
I wanna be
Touched by you
I wanna be
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be
Anything you want me to
Don't mean nothing when you're growing old
Nobody knows what the future holds
I am left with a bitter taste
Turn away from that beautiful chase
I'm always there for you baby
You let me see
If we can get closer everyday
I wanna be
Held by you
I wanna be
Touched by you
I wanna be
I wanna be loved by you

Anything you want me to

If I could stroll 'cross the sands of time
I'd call my cronies up an' drink some wine
'Cause just the other day I heard you died
Disappeared when you was in your prime
An' I'm fightin' hard
Stompin' 'round on my grandma land
I held my little son in my hand
I know he knowed that I understand
He tryin' hard just to be a man yeah
An' he's fightin' hard
I told him folks don't have a clue
Where you're from or where you're goin' to
An' sometime baby gets so hard to deal
With folks that believe wrestlin' is real
An' we fightin' hard
If I could stroll 'cross the sands of time
I'd call my cronies up and drink some wine
'Cause all we got's just a little time
'Fore we all gotta say goodbye
An' I'm fightin' hard
An' I'm fightin' hard
The pages of my history
Ain't no great big mystery
For the price of petty bribes
Separation of the tribes
Men with guns have leadeth us
Down their path of righteousness
A thousand trips around the sun
Hard to tell who lost and won
Who lost
The faces in the mist I see
Ain't no great big mystery
Loss of heart loss of mind
Lost some chrome through tests of time
Through tests of time
You need meat go to the market
You need bread try the bakery
If you need love baby
Don't go no farther
Just come on home with me
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody
I got to love somebody

You need grits go to the grocery
You need fish go to the sea

Way back yonder in the days of old

Then came a woman lookin' real cool
She said to herself "Now that's my fool"
I'm gonna ball tonight

Well you can't break the rule because every man is some woman's fool
Met a girl on the avenue

Like a teacher and a student in the school
Looked at me and said "You're my fool"
Gonna ball tonight

But I don't think I'm gonna make it
Wham bam people got a hold on me
And I just can't seem to shake it
I'm always down since I hit this town
Lord knows it sure is a pity

Anyway you see it it remains the same
Livin' like this is a cryin' shame

All my life I've been tryin' to save
To get a pair of cowboy boots
Sixteen years of my life I gave
To get a pair of cowboy boots
I wanna go where the money's free
Hollywood is callin' me
Oh what a great big star I'll be
In a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna get on a tv show
In a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna ride in a rodeo-ooo
In a pair of cowboy boots
I wanna go where the badman lurk
Get me a job an' go to work
Give a lesson to Wyatt Earp
In a pair of cowboy boots
Oh give me a home
Where the swimmin' pools roll on
Where the money grows on trees
And the gals just wanna be squeezed
I'm gonna get there if I have to crawl
To get a pair of cowboy boots
Get in the movies and that ain't all
In a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna get me a leather vest
Gun on my hip and star on my chest
I'll be the tale of the golden west
In a pair of cowboy boots
Oh give me a home
Where the swimmin' pools roll on
Where the money grows on trees
And the gals just wanna be squeezed
I'm gonna get there if I have to crawl
To get a pair of cowboy boots
Get in the movies and that ain't all
In a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna get me a leather vest
Gun on my hip a star on my chest
I'll be the tale of the golden west
In a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
Well I guess when you met me
That it were just one of those things
Don't you ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me
Oh you're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together unhappy together
Won't that be fine
Day may be cloudy or sunny
We're either in or we're out of our money
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together unhappy together

Rain or shine

I'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me everything
I said I'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me everything
And it makes me feel so good just to hear my baby call my name
My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I could sing
Hey my baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I could sing
I feel just like I'm a millionaire when I hear my baby call my name
Oh there ain't nobody like my baby that's the reason I love her so
Oh ain't nobody nobody like my baby that's the reason I love her so
People I would even die for her I want the whole round world to know
When I'm down she'll picks me up she says "Daddy you can't lose"
Oh when I'm down when I'm down she picks me up tells me "Baby you can't lose"
When all of my friends forget about me my baby keeps away all these blues
You won't listen to nothing I tell you baby you keep on doing just as you please
Hey you won't do nothing I tell you baby keep on doing as you please
I've taken as long as I can baby when is this foolishness gonna cease
I've worried myself crazy baby cried both night and day
I said I've worried myself crazy baby cried both night and day
You don't believe me baby but I'm gonna leave one of these days
Well you told me that you love me but actions speak louder than words
Oh you said you love me baby but action speaks louder than words
I won't be fooled no longer baby that line everybody's heard
Well If you're gonna change baby you better do it real soon
Hey If you're gonna change for the better baby you better do it real soon
Because you'll wake up one of these mornings find yourself in a empty room
Got a tale to tell
Gonna carry it to the world
'Bout I came and I saw yeah
Trees was dyin' chillun cryin' yeah
Fish was floatin' famine risin'
Father son
On the run
Chillun' stole from their mothers
World o' pain some insane
Make a mule out of others
Watch your mouth
Don't you shout
Even talk without knowin'
Future man he understand
Where I been an' where I'm goin'
Got a tale to tell
Gonna carry it to the world
'Bout I came an' I saw
Cryin' Lord I wonder will I ever ooo get back ho-ooome
Cryin' Lord I wonder will I ever ooo get back ho-ooome
I wonder ooo will I ever ooo-hoo get back ho-ooome
Said I walked and I'm wondering cryin' all night lo-oong
Said I walked and I'm wondering cryin' all night lo-oong
Cryin' I wonder ooo will I ever ooo-hoo get back ho-oome
So many days I done traveling way-sided more
So many days I done traveling way-sided more
Wonder if possible ooo will I ever ooo get back ho-oome
It'll get better
You will never ever see me any more
You will never ever see me any more
But you'll never ooo forget the day I knocked hoo-ooo on your door
And Lord I wonder will I ooo-ooo ever get back ho-oome
Cryin' Lord I wonder will I ooo-ooo ever get back ho-oome
Cryin' I wonder ooo will I ever ooo-hoo get back home
