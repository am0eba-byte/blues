Man replies: Sho' nuf man
Memphis Slim: Yeah man
Other man: Well tell me about her

Her hair looks just like a chinchilla coat
You get close up on her she smells just like a goat
You know she's smellin'
Got bo all the time
And she thinks soap and water
Is a doggone crime
Now her ears are so long her nose is flat
Her head's so big she can't wear no hat
Now her jaws are swollen and she's got one eye
She looks like a wreck that happened last July
She's a ugly
Got bo all the time
And she thinks soap and water
Is a doggone crime
Now she must-a been her mother only child
She should be a gorilla because she sure is wild
Got ways like a monkey and sly as a fox
She should be in a chain gang breakin' up rocks
Because she's ugly
Got bo all the time
And she thinks soap and water
Is a doggone crime
Now she got legs like a needle
She ain't got no chin
She's a beautiful woman for the shape she's in
Her feet look like swings way out on a limb
That's why her mother put her off on him
Because she bo-gish
She's got bo all the time
And she thinks soap and water
Is a doggone crime
