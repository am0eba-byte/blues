It happened long time ago in a little country town way back in Mississippi
It rained and it rained it rained both night and day
The people got worried they began to cry
"Lord have mercy where can we go now"
There were women and there was children screaming and crying
"Lord have mercy and a great disaster who can we turn to now but you"
The great flood of Tupelo Mississippi
It happened one evenin' one Friday evenin' a long time ago

The people of Tupelo out on the farm gathering their harvest
a dark cloud rolled way back in Tupelo Mississippi hmm hmm

Went down to Albert's Alley
Pick up on me a Collins mix
Went to the bar an' ordered me a drink
Tried to relax myself
Looked around and saw two soul sisters
They were sippin' sodas
And the other look caught their companions
On the dance floor
They were doin' the Collin's shuffle
Pretty soon a cute little number
Came and asked me to do the stomp polka
I told her I couldn't do the stomp polka
I could show her how to do the Sissy
We were on the dance floor
And I was doin' my thing
After a while out of nowhere
Up walks her boyfriend
While she's standin' there doin' the shivers and shake
He gave me a look that was very icy blue
And believe me he made me thaw out
I said to myself "Albert don't lose your cool"
By that time I'd gotten hungry
'Cause I smelled someone cookin' catfish
Oughta be something along with some greens
Told him definitely I didn't want no leftovers
The cook took so long about fixin' my grub
I had to go see what was takin' him so long
He was back there jivin'
I had to tell him to get it together
He asked me "Can't you wait"
Made me mad I said "No man I ain't got time
I've got to keep on pushin'
I got to make it down the soul road
Got to go do some turnin' on"
Don't want person give me no dyin' food
So I'm leavin' town goin' home
I've got homesick anyway
I'm leavin' this place before I freeze
Goin' home to defrost
Ain't gonna have me lookin' like a snow cone
I don't know he's gettin' rough
All you girls think the days are gone
You don't have to worry you can have your fun
Take me baby for your little boy
Three hundred pounds of heavenly joy
This is it
This is it
Look what you get
You been creeping and hiding behind his back
'Cause you got you a man that you don't like
Throw that Jack baby outta your mind
Follow me baby have a real good time
This is it
This is it
Look what you get
Hoy Hoy I'm the boy
Three hundred pounds of heavenly joy
I'm so glad that you understand
Three hundred pounds of muscle and man
This is it

Look what you get
If the men's all mad then the women's glad
If the little kids' happy then the old folk's mad

Three hundred pounds of muscle and man
This is it

Look what you get

Everything fight about little spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful

Could be a spoonful of tea
But a little spoon of your precious love
Good enough for me
Men lies about that
Some of them dies about that
Some of them cries about that
But everything fight about that spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful
It could be a spoonful of water
Saved from the deserts sand
But one spoon of them fortifies
Save you from another man
Men lies about that
Some of them cries about that
Some of them dies about that
Everybody fightin' about that spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful

But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Aw but one thing
Really give me the blues
When I wore a hole
In my last pair of shoes
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Just keep on a-bettin'
About the dice don't pass
You're gonna leave here runnin'
Almost too fast
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Don't like everybody
In my neighborhood
I got a no-good woman
She don't mean me no good
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the pleasure hotels
They brought him back out and said "Set him up" cous's payin' for
His money got a little lighter they lured him out from the Lute and brought him down to Robert's
And then he said "Set him up" cous's payin' for
And then the dollars bein' more money then my man had ever had began to run out
Then they moved him out and put him down with the
And then ladies and gentlemen the go-go girls would get fewer
His friends was fewer

And then it happened all his buddies were gone
And my man knew only one thing to do it was getting cold there like it is today
you know what I'm talking about
He went down to the railroad yard
and one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent his money came by to see him
And she said "You fool you fool" I wouldn't have spend your money but the rest of them was spending your money so I decided to spend my portion too you know
But ladies God bless 'em wonderful something's aren't they
They always like to feel like they're needed and she knew my man needed her bad
