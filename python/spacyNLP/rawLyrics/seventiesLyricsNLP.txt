When I come home in the morning
And I knock on the door
I don't get that glad-to-see-you welcome
The glad-to-see-you welcome any more
Oh but to me
It's just like it used to be baby
Because you are still my woman
You know a change have come
And I guess I'll blame it on fate
The thing that once was love
It now seems to turn to hate
Oh I guess it's too late
For me now baby
But you are still my woman
You know I tried to be
The man you wanted me to be
But whatever I do baby
It seems to add to your misery
Oh you can do
What you want to baby
But you are still my woman
You know I'm still hoping and praying
That someday I'll find
Someone to love me
So I can have love and peace of mind
Oh I still love you
Like I did before baby
Because you are still my woman
Your friends are all telling you
That I'm a no good so-and-so
They say that love and affection
Have now turned to a heart
A heart that's old and cold
It's the same old story
Same old story that's so often told
You are still my woman
You got to lose
You can't win all the time
You got to lose
You can't win all the time
Well I know pretty baby
I see trouble comin' down the line
Well I was out on the streets baby
I did not have no money
Don't you worry pretty baby
I'll be back on my feet soon honey
You got to lose
You can't win all the time
Well I know pretty baby
I see trouble comin' down the line
You got to lose
You can't win all the time
You got to lose
You can't win all the time
Yes I know pretty baby
I see trouble comin' down the line
Yeah I was out on the streets
I did not have no friends
I didn't have no money
And nothing I could spend
You got to lose
You can't win all the time
Well I know pretty baby
I see trouble comin' down the line
Had a sweet little girl I lose my baby boy ain't that bad
Had a sweet little girl I lose my baby boy ain't that bad
You can't spend what you ain't got
you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had
Had money in the bank I got busted people ain't that bad
Had money in the bank I got busted people ain't that bad
You can't spend what you ain't got
you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had
Ain't that the truth boys
Had a sweet little home it got burned down people ain't that bad
My own fault people ain't that bad
Well you know you can't spend what you ain't got
you can't lose some blues you ain't never had
Have mercy
Sweet little home got burned down people ain't that bad
Yeah you know I had a sweet little home it got burned down people ain't that bad
Whoa you know you can't spend what you ain't got
you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had
We've met before
In the same room of my imagination
And it gets so hard to deal with
Out strike temptation yes it does
Yesterday in my mind
You were here but now we've parted
You need to come on back
And finish what we started oh baby

Who are you gonna give yourself to
And what are your plans
Tell me baby

And where are you going
Will you give yourself to me
Or some other man

You started what I thought
You intended to finish
You were right here yesterday
But today you vanished
When I woke up something told me
That I had been used
But I liked it
And when I couldn't find you
Lord it gave me the blues
Now I really need to know
Who are you
And where did you come from
And where did you come from baby

Well I'm glad just to get on and home tonight

Well I'll be ridin' on the bus till I Cadillac
All spoken
Went down to Albert's Alley
Pick up on me a Collins mix
Went to the bar an' ordered me a drink
Tried to relax myself
Looked around and saw two soul sisters
They were sippin' sodas
And the other look caught their companions
On the dance floor
They were doin' the Collin's shuffle
Pretty soon a cute little number
Came and asked me to do the stomp polka
I told her I couldn't do the stomp polka
I could show her how to do the Sissy
We were on the dance floor
And I was doin' my thing
After a while out of nowhere
Up walks her boyfriend
While she's standin' there doin' the shivers and shake
He gave me a look that was very icy blue
And believe me he made me thaw out
I said to myself "Albert don't lose your cool"
By that time I'd gotten hungry
'Cause I smelled someone cookin' catfish
Oughta be something along with some greens
Told him definitely I didn't want no leftovers
The cook took so long about fixin' my grub
I had to go see what was takin' him so long
He was back there jivin'
I had to tell him to get it together
He asked me "Can't you wait"
Made me mad I said "No man I ain't got time
I've got to keep on pushin'
I got to make it down the soul road
Got to go do some turnin' on"
Don't want person give me no dyin' food
So I'm leavin' town goin' home
I've got homesick anyway
I'm leavin' this place before I freeze
Goin' home to defrost
Ain't gonna have me lookin' like a snow cone
I don't know he's gettin' rough
Took the car and drove off the hills
Saw the flashing lights and saw them die
Left behind society that kills
Me and Nancy waved them all goodbye
Took the car the sun was going down
Saw the changing colors of the sky
An old Apache canyon out campground
Secure and safe together made us sigh
Took the car and filled the trunk with wood
Took it back and made of it a fire
To be a child again would be so good
Me and Nancy warm in our desire
Took the car and drove it everywhere
Through the land where all the West began
Desert wind was blowing in our hair
Me and Nancy running hand in hand
All you people you know the blues got a soul
Well this is a story a story never been told
Well you know the blues got pregnant
And they named the baby Rock & Roll
Muddy Waters said it you know the blues got a soul
James Brown said it you know the blues got a soul
Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby rock & roll
Ray Charles said it you know the blues got a soul
John Lee Hooker said it you know the blues got a soul
Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby rock & roll
Otis Redding said it you know the blues got a soul
Queen Victoria said it you know the blues got a soul
Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby Rock & Roll
When I first met you we burned like a flame
Now it's gettin' colder and you know that's a same
Love's out there somewhere but you know it won't come in
So let's remember baby how sweet all this has been
But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
You know that's the beginning of the end
I make you sparkle like strawberry wine
And when I felt bad you make me feel fine
Oh it's good when it's goin' and gone when it's gone
We both know enough to leave well enough alone
When two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
Baby can't you see that's the beginning of the end
The cool of the morning the heat of the night
The loving was good but you know it just wasn't right
Someday when you wake up and call out my name
Don't feel bad about it I'll probably do the same
But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
Baby don't ya know that's the beginning of the end
Oh you come home one eve'nin'
To nothin' but the four walls
And then ya find your phone been disconnected
You can't even make no call
Ya hung out for your baby oh an'she's not there
You look in the closet buddy an'you find it's all bare
Oh that's what the blues is people
That's what the blues is all about
Well that's a hard pill to have to swallow um
When you find what the blues is all about
Now listen to this:
I went out to my backyard
Ya know I whistled for my dog [ whistle sounds]
He ran up under the house people
Like he didn't even know me at all
Now I hadn't fed him in two or three days
An' he was lookin' kinda thin
Oh when your dog turn his back on ya buddy
You know ya haven't even got a friend
That's the blues people
That's what the blues is all about
Oh it's a hard pill to swallow um
When ya find out what the blues is all about
Oh look out
Uh
Oh no
I think I got 'em
I went out to my mail box
I got a bunch-a bills that I can't pay
I guess my wife been out shoppin' again
While I been at work all day
I see the man comin' with his tools
Now is he gonna cut off my water
You know they got my gas yesterday
An' they comin' right back for the lines tomorrow
Ah that's what the blues is people
That's what the blues is all about
Well that's a hard pill to swallow buddy
Oh when you find out what the blues is all about
Way down South there's a clear stream running
In the night I feel my heart turning
I'm feeling some day I'd like to come
Back to the place I started from
Take it home
Country night with the stars above me
Way down there with the ones who love me
Mother Sister Father Son
They mean more than anyone
Take it home
Fall winds blow and the red leaves falling
Don't know there's a voice keeps calling
Saying you have found your song
You've been gone so long
Take it home
Seems my life is a long road winding
Gone so far but the ties are binding
I'll pack up my bags and fly away
To a far better day
Take it home
Don't know why I was made to wander
I've seen the light lord I've felt the thunder
Someday I'll go home again
And I know they'll take me in
Take it home
C'mon children we got soul food in the house
We got cornbread mash potato a-candied yam an' turnip greens
We got a little chitlin' it's soul food
I see the preacher comin' we're fixin' a plate
"Will ya pass the biscuit please"
Shut-up boy an' eat them greens
It's soul food ya get your stomach full
Want ya to eat ya'all
I'm gonna play for ya
Ow Woo
I see a man headed 'cross the track
Food was so good I see he's comin' back
It's soul food
It's soul food
It's soul food
It's soul food
It's soul food
It's soul food
It's soul food
It's soul food
Well I'm tryin' yes I'm tryin just to get a line on you where you been
But I'm havin' trouble puttin' a find on you I'm wearin' thin
Somebody else been shaking your tree supposed to saving all that stuff for me
You been hidin' yes you're hidin' you been stayin' out on me sneakin' 'round
Me and you ain't workin' out just like we oughta be you've got me down
Somebody else been shaking your tree supposed to be saving all that stuff for me
I'm tired of foolin' around with you and sittin' here alone it's on my mind
I think it's time for me to find a new tree of my own it's plantin' time
Anything you wanna do is cool with me I don't care who shakes your
tree
She don't love me she love my automobile
She don't love me she love my automobile
Well she would do anything just to slide behind the wheel
She said "What's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down"
She said "What's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down"
I said "Honey why don't you ask me when we get to the outskirts of town"
Well now she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk
Well she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk
Long as she got the keys and there's a spare wheel in her trunk
She told me she'd been loved before
If I took a little less
She'd give a little more
She told me she'd been hurt a lot
But somehow she still knew
What a woman's love was for
She said if I would take a second-hand woman
The night wouldn't be so long
She said if I would take a second-hand woman
She'd put love where love belonged
I said that's alright with me
I'll do everything I can
After all baby I'm a second-hand man
I showed her Where I hid the scars
From all the battles I had fought
In lost and lonely wars
It took al night for us to understand
Life had led to us
Loves old soft and healing hand
One hand will take one hand will give
That's all we know and that is how we live
One day hello next day goodbye
And everyone just stay high
Same old story same old song
Goes all right till it goes all wrong
Now you're going then you're gone
Same old story same old song
One builds you up one tears you down
To some you're a saint to others you're a clown
What can you do just see it through
And hold on to what is left to you
Same old story same old song
Goes all right till it goes all wrong
Now you're going then you're gone
Same old story same old song
I've been chasin' after you babe
It seem like a mighty long time
Oh I think I'm about to reach
Reach the end of my line
Oh the more I think of you baby
The further from me you get it seems
Oh I guess I'm never gonna catch you baby
'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam
Aww
The first time I saw you girl
It marked the beginnin' of my chase
I've been runnin' after you ever since
And I haven't got any place
Oh the more I chase you baby
The further from me you get it seems
Oh I guess I ain't never gonna catch you girl
'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam
Even though I really love you girl
Chasin' you is just like chasin' the devil
The harder I run the more ya have fun
Now I know you wouldn't care if it lasts forever
'Cause the more I chase ya baby
The further from me you get it seems
I guess I ain't never gonna catch you girl
'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam
Oh
I worked hard today
An' I'm tired as a man can be
I'm not too tired for some a-your lovin'
The love you give straight to me
I never get tired of what ya got darlin'
You know where it's at
I love the way ya rub my back
I work on a construction job
I work long hours ev'ryday
Oh my head is achin' when I get home
But I want your lovin' anyway
Oh you know how to ease the pain
An' that's a fact
An' I love the way you rub my back
Your love kills my pain
It kills my pain ev'ry night
Oh you're ninety-six pounds baby
You're ninety-six pounds a-dynamite
After I play with the kids
I'm ready to relax
You can put the kids to bed
An' come an' rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back

Fading:

Rub my back
Get it while it's hot
I've been all over Europe
And across the sea
With each new place
It gets clearer to me
Week after week
On tour with my band
You don't have to speak
'Cause they all understand
The power of the blues
Hey hey the power of the blues
And that's good news
I'm talking about the power of the blues
Yes it's just a few changes
That I won't deny
But if you think it's easy
You just give it a try
You know the truth
But you're afraid to say it
That it ain't what I play
It's the way that I play it
That's the power of the blues
Yes the power of the blues
You'll change your views
When you hear the power of the blues
Now me and Lucille
We're gonna stop this war
I'm no politician
But I know the score
You can call me a hawk
Or maybe I'm a dove
But all we gotta do
Is shoot 'em full of love
With the power of the blues
Hey the power of the blues
It's the thing to use
Talking about the power of the blues
Yes I am
Try it one more please
You know I got to find me
People I got to find me
A part time love
Oh I need
I need me a part time love
Every time
Every time my baby leaves me
You know I need a part time love
The people in the cemetery
They're not all alone
Some turn to dust
And some have bone
You know I'd rather be dead
Six feet in my grave
Than to live lonely
Each and everyday
I need me
I need me a part time love
Every time my woman leaves me
You know I need a part time love
She came home this morning
I asked her where she'd been
She said "Don't ask me
No questions baby
'Cause I'll be leaving again"
I've got to find me
Don't you see I've got to find me
A part time love
My baby leaves me
I need a part time love
Yes I do
Oh every time my woman leaves me
Have to suffer
The whole time she's gone
I got to say it again
When she leaves me
I suffer every time she's gone
When she leaves me
I just got to have me a part time love
Is there somebody out there
Oh I need
Mm I need me a part time love
Can't say it too much
I need oh I need
I've gotten good at missin' her I practice all the time
While I drive the Pan Am highway thru with that cactus friend of mine
It's gettin' hard to see the white line rollin' by I can't forget her memory deep inside
I dropped a bundle down in Panama but the loss didn't do me no good
Spendin' cash and talkin' trash don't do it like it should
I realized I just couldn't buy her smile I'll keep tryin' on that Pan Am mile by mile
If she'd meet me in San Salvador I'd buy her a drink or two
We'd talk about our used to be and ride on to Peru
The time to get it right is here and now if she won't I'll move on
anyhow
My head is spinnin' around
And I'm thinkin' my thoughts of you
Whoa baby I'm thinkin' about you
Well I get so mixed up now baby
And I don't know what to do
Oh baby I don't know what to do
I'm gonna pack it up
I'm gonna give it up
I'm gonna put you right out of my mind
I'm gonna pack it up
Gonna give it up baby
I'm gonna put you right out of my mind
Hey I tried my best to understand
You keep sayin' it'll work out fine
But baby don't look like it will
Every time I try to talk to you baby
You tell me you ain't got time
But baby I don't know what's wrong with you
But let me tell you
I'm gonna pack it up
Gonna give it up woman
I'm gonna put you right out of my life
Hey I'm gonna pack it up
Gonna give it up baby
Gonna put you right out of my life
After all we been through together
Why did it end this way
But baby it did
I put all my trust in you baby
Believe every word I say
Oh baby I love you so much
I'm gonna pack it up
Gonna give it up
I got to get you right out of my life
Hey I got to pack it up

I think I'going out of my mind
Three days of snow in Birmingham
Thought you would wonder where I am
Rang our number all night long
It's no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said you moved away
And left me all your bills to pay
Look out baby you might have made your move too soon
Left me with a Keno card
This life in Vegas sure ain't hard
I ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand
That kind of word can get around
And make a lost love come up found
I hear you knocking baby at my door
But you know you ain't living here no more
It's too bad
I think you made your move too soon
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back and they still care you know
One love ahead
One love behind
One in my arms and one on my mind
It's one thing baby
I never make my move too soon
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back you know they still all care
One love ahead and one behind
One in my arms you know one on my mind
And it's one thing people
I never make my move too soon
Neighbor neighbor why you messin' in my life
Neighbor neighbor you've been talkin' to my wife
Tellin' her you seen me runnin' wild the other night runnin' wild the other night
A neighbor neighbor there's always one in every crowd
A neighbor neighbor tellin' lies and talkin' loud
You better watch your step now you might fall off your cloud you might fall off your cloud
Now I was walking down a dusty road when along came a neighbor of mine
He saw me walkin' with my head hung down he just had to stop and pass the time
Neighbor neighbor floatin' in the salty brine floatin' in the salty brine
My pretty girl is sitting in her room of red
My pretty girl lying on her furry bed
Pretty as the moonlight
I only want to treat her right
My pretty girl doing something to her hair
My pretty girl dressing up with special care
Pretty as the moonlight
I only want to treat her right
My pretty girl making me feel her man
My pretty girl hugging me when she can
Pretty as the moonlight
I only want to treat her right
My pretty girl sleeping in the still of night
My pretty girl glowing in the candlelight
Pretty as the moonlight
I only want to treat her right
My baby don't stand no cheating my babe
No my baby don't stand no cheating my baby
My baby don't stand no cheatin'
She don't stand none a-that midnight creepin'
My babe is a true little baby my baby
My baby I know she loves me my baby

My baby I know she loves me
All she wanna do is kiss an' hug me

So let the good times roll let the good times roll
And live a long long
I don't care if you are young or old no no get together and let the good times roll
Don't stand there moaning talking trash
If you wanna have some fun you'd better go out and spend some cash
And let the good time roll

Don't stand there moaning talking trash
If you wanna have some fun you'd better go out and spend some cash

Let the good times roll
I don't care if you young or old
Let's get together and let the good times roll
You know by now that I've been passed
Through an awful lot of hands
And all I have is what is left
From ten thousand one night stands
Sometimes I feel like I was there
When the blues began
With this crying guitar holding me
Like a woman holds a man
Let me make you cry a little longer
Let me make you high a little longer
Oh I want to try a little longer
Make some woman sigh a little longer
At night sometimes I can still feel
Every place I've ever been
I feel it in my music
And it all comes back again
You know I've played for city lights
And for stars above
And every note I ever play
I always play for love
Let me make you cry a little longer
Let me make you high a little longer
Oh I want to try a little longer
Make some woman sigh a little longer

"I'll be home" well last week that's what she said
"I'll be home" well last week that's what she said

'Cause she don't know how the rent is paid
She's a gamblin' woman she chases men in between
She's a gamblin' girl she chases men in between
She mistreats me and she cheats me
Meanest woman I ever seen
The kid's in bed I lay awake 'till broad daylight
The kid's in bed I lay awake 'till broad daylight

But if you come with me tonight
And stayed
At least we'd know
It wasn't loneliness we made
You don't have to know my past
It's much too much for me and you
If the sadness has to show
I guess I'll let it through
We can go till it's gone
And give it all we've got
Sometimes anything can mean a lot
I need you so to keep me happy
If I can't have you I cannot go on
I need your arms around me tightly

Longing for you no one else will do

My song is a serious matter
It reflects what I feel
If I say I love you I mean it
'Cause in my song
Every line is for real
Every man or woman
Enjoys going home
To a peaceful situation
To give love and receive love
Without any complications
Whether my tune is short or long
Whether my lyrics are weak or strong
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
Music is love
And my love is music
In perfect harmony
So when I sing
I have sung all about
The love of you and me
I never got angry with my guitar
'Cause when I strike a chord
It gives me what I wanna hear
So I'm finding out that
We are quite like my song together my dear
Outside answers
Should always be forbidden
Problems should be solved
And never hidden
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
You let me down
All over town
I guess by now I should be gone
Yet here I stand
Still in your hands
Cause you're the best I've ever known
I try and try to say good-bye
I just can't leave your love alone
And after you what will I do
I just can't leave your love alone
I walk away most everyday
Don't need a love that hurts me so
Then every night you get it right
Until I'm moaning soft and low
I try and try to say good-bye
I just can't leave your love alone
And after you what will I do
I just can't leave your love alone
Two kind of people I just can't stand
That's an evil-hearted woman and a lyin' man
Don't you lie to me
No don't you lie to me
Because it make me mad
I get evil as a man can be
You told me that you loved me a long time ago
The fellow that you got you don't want him no more
Don't you lie to me ha ha
No don't you lie to me
Because it makes me mad girl
I get evil as a man can be

Sometimes I get impatient

And she comes so sweet and so plain
my hummingbird and have you heard
that I thought my life had ended
But I find that it's just begun
'cause she gets me where I live
I'll give all I have to give
I'm talking about that hummingbird
Oh she's little and she loves me
too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
she's little and she loves me
To my lucky day
Hummingbird don't fly away
When I'm feeling wild and lonesome
she knows the words to say
And she gives me a little understanding
in her special way
And I just have to say
in my life I loved a woman
Because she's more than I deserve
and she gets me where I live
I'll give all I have to give
I'm talking about that hummingbird
Oh she's little and she loves me
too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
she's little and she loves me
To my lucky day

I've been down hearted baby ever since the day we met
I said I've been down hearted baby ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues baby how blue can you get
You're evil when I'm with you baby and you're jealous when we're apart
I said you're evil when I'm with you baby and you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby the answer is right here in my heart
I gave you a brand new Ford but you said: "I want a Cadillac"
I bought you a ten dollar dinner and you said: thanks for the snack
I let you live in my penthouse you said it just a shack
I gave seven children and now you wanna give them back
I said I've been down hearted baby ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues baby how blue can you get
Turn out the light sleep won't come
I think about what's going wrong
Lying so close so alone
Please turn to me I'm almost gone
Hold on I feel our love is changing
Hold on please don't let me disappear
Hold on there's time to rearrange things
Hold on I'm not me without you here
Put out your hand touch desire
Where there's a spark could be a fire
Open your arms let me see
If there's still love in you for me
Hold on I feel our love is changing
Hold on please don't let me disappear
Hold on there's time to rearrange things
Hold on I'm not me without you here
I want your hi fi mama won't you let me play it tonight

Hi fi lo fi no fi's just fine with me
Hi fi lo fi no fi's just fine with me
And if you want to give me stereo first give me vitamin E
I got your name and your number
Baby lights her cigarette
And takes a look around
She says that morning sun
Sure does get her down
Nothing else to see
Just to help her lose
Those happy birthday blues
Grandpa takes a drink of wine
And tells it like it was
Tells me all he wants to do
Is what everybody does
Say he'd give the world
For a little girl
Just to help him lose
Those happy birthday blues
Happy birthday blues
Happy birthday blues
Got to pay your dues
Those happy birthday blues
In and out and on and on
Everybody goes
And where the fun with finally stops
Everybody knows
Girls it's me and you
Doing what we do
Just one way to lose
Those happy birthday blues

She's just a ghetto woman waitin' for her man to come home
Oh she's just a ghetto woman waitin' for her man to come home
Said she's a ghetto woman waitin' for her man to come home
A rat run cross the floor a roach ran up the wall
Everything is noise around her that don't seem to bother her at all
Ghetto woman sittin' there all alone
She's a ghetto woman waitin' for her man to come home
Yes the tv's on radio blastin' the news
Somebody down the hall playin' the low down dirty blues
Oh ghetto woman she's all alone
She's just a ghetto woman waitin' for her man to come home
Oh she's a ghetto woman she's a ghetto woman
Oh ghetto woman what's on your mind
Sometimes I look in your face can't help but cry
Get out of my life woman you don't no love me no more
I said "Get out of my life woman you don't no love me no more
Get out of my life woman you don't no love me no more"
Get out my eyes teardrops I got to see my way around
Won't you get out my eyes teardrops I got to see my way around
Get out my life heartaches nothing but heartaches by the pound
Get off my ladder woman I got to climb up to the top
I said "Get off my ladder woman I got to climb up to the top
Get off my ladder woman ladder's nothing to make you stop"
Get out the way woman I got to be movin' on

Get out the way woman I got to be movin' on"
If you ever been mistreated then you know just what I'm talkin' about

And said ain't she pretty

Everyday everyday I have the blues
Everyday everyday I have the blues

My loving woman and me lying in the sand
We#;re on a holiday out in a foreign land
Sunny day
We can play
Lazing by the deep blue sea
Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own
Go underwater and see another world of green
Fishes go by and I get to wondering where they#;ve been
Sunny day
We can play
Lazing by the deep blue sea
Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own
Take out a boat and paddle it around the bay
Pressures from the world seem to fade away
Sunny day
We can play
Sailing on the deep blue sea
Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own
I#;m crying
Yes I#;m crying
And I just don#;t know
How it#;s all going to end
I#;m thinking back a long time
When I hit my woman down
It was a bad bad evil night
When I realized what I#;d done
It was way too late too late
Too late for words and I#;m crying
In torment sometimes
We hurt each other so bad
Nobody to turn to no going back
No such thing as God for us
No more to touch her body
No more to stroke her hair
All I can do is break down in tears
I#;m crying and wondering
Where am I now because of what I did
I just don#;t know and I#;m crying
It was a long time ago
The pain is over now
But I still think back sometimes
And remember how I cried
I was crying
Yeah I'm so sorry
I got to leave my woman alone
Yeah I'm so sorry
I got to leave my woman alone
Well you know she got a crosseyed cat
livin' without that man in her home
Every time I start to see this woman
he's in the corner growlin' or layin' down
Every time I start to see this woman
he's in the corner growlin' or layin' down
Yeah you know he's too big to be a house cat
and he's too small to be a lion
There's somethin' wrong
Yeah I stop by my baby's house
he start jumpin' from wall to wall
Yeah I stop by my baby's house
he start jumpin' from wall to wall
Then he's lookin' crosseyed at me
sit back in the corner and licked his paw
Yeah my woman got a crosseyed cat
livin' there with her in her home
Yeah my woman got a crosseyed cat
livin' there with her in her home
You know I try so hard to do her right
but it seem like everything I do is wrong

Early one morning while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down
I shot her down then I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head
Woke up next morning and I grabbed that gun
I took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
In the hot joint takin' the pill
there walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
you're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Yes so my name's is Billy Lee
if you've got a warrant you better read it to me
I shot her down 'cause she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
they threw me on a freight train and hauled me back
Had no friend who'd go my bail
they stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail
Early next morning 'round half past nine
I saw the sheriff comin' down the line
That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat
said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court
Into the courtroom my trial began
where I was judged by twelve honest men
Yes as the jury started walkin' out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes then walked a man
holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me
The judge he smiled when he picked up his pen
ninety-nine years in the San Quentin Penn
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
but I can't forget that day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you hotheads you listen to me
stay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
Hey I went 'cross town to see my woman
I knocked upon her door
She said "Baby I'm glad ya stopped by
I just can't see ya no more"
Honey you've been replaced
Honey you've been replaced
I need a change of pace
I need a change of pace
Well I found a new face so

Woke up this morning
after another one of those crazy dreams
Oh nothing is going right this morning
the whole world is wrong it seems
Oh I guess it's the chain that bind me
I can't shake it loose these chains and things
Got to work this morning
seems like everything is lost
I got a cold hearted wrong doing woman
and a slave driving ball
I can't loosen these chains that bind me
can't shake them loosen these chains and things
Just can't loosen these chains and things
Well you talk about hard luck and trouble
seems to be my middle name
All the odds are against me
yes I can only play a losing game
These chains that bind me
can't loosen these chains and things
Just can't loosen these chains and things
Oh I would pack up and leave today people
but I ain't got nowhere to go
Ain't got money to buy a ticket
and I don't feel like walking anymore
These chains that bind me
I can't lose I can't lose these chains and things
I woke up this mornin' with these certified blues they sure been stalkin' me 'round
So down tonight I couldn't tie my shoes
They about to drop me in the ground
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind
These certified blues are gonna take their time
I've been livin' here way down South a place that I wanna stay
Been workin' hard just to feed my mouth
Just can keep them blues away
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind
These certified blues are gonna take their time
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine
You say you're feelin' bad and you don't know why
You're broke and your woman been ly'n'
And just one thing before I'm fired the blues have just been certified
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind
These certified blues are gonna take their time
Spoken:

Born under a bad sign

I've been around and I've seen some things
People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet
People living like Superman
All day and all night
And I won't say if it's wrong or if it's right
I'm pretty fast myself
But I do have some advice to pass along
Along in the chorus of this song
Better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day
That girl have lived in love and for love
and over love and under love all her life
If the arrows from cupid's bow that had
passed through her heart had been sticking
Out of her body she would have looked like a porcupine
And she asked me "BB do you think I've lived my life all wrong"
And I said: "The only advice I have to pass
along in the chorus of this song" girl
Better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning in London England
And there was a very large Rolls Royce limousine
pulling slowly along the street
And in that Rolls Royce was the queen of England looking tired
Just go back from a party and the queen leaned out and
she said: "Aren't you BB King"
She said: "Oh BB sometimes it's so hard to pull things together
Could you tell me what you think I ought to do"
And I said:
Better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
Better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down

That's what I'm talkin' about
I said work now let's get it
Let's get the organ a little bit
"Albert let's get a drummin' some maybe"
Ah man it's too late now
Don't care when you go how long you stay
Good time treatments bring you back someday
Oh but someday baby I ain't gonna worry my life any more
Ain't but one thing give me the blues
When I've worn a hole in my last pair of shoes
Oh but someday baby I ain't gonna worry my life any more
You and me don't see eye to eye
On every little thing
We've missed a lot of sunshine
And caught a lot of rain
If you want to leave I can't make you stay
But there is something I have to say
No matter how high you get
Or how low you go
There's one thing darling
You ought to know
There's a world full of strangers out there
A world full of strangers
Beware
There's a world full of strangers out there
And if it gets too strange
Just come on home
Restless hearts looking for a love
Are waiting in the street
They're all prepared to give you
The bitter with the sweet
If you wake someday and you reach for me
Well you know this is where I'll be
No matter how high you get
Or how low you go
There's one thing darling
You ought to know
There's a world full of strangers out there
A world full of strangers
Beware
There's a world full of strangers out there
And if it gets too strange
Just come on home
Went to a party the New York style
I met a lady make a sane man wild
She said the words only her lips could say
She made me want to throw my life away
But when I asked her she said "Maybe tomorrow BB"
And that's a story everybody knows
I took her flying out across the sea
I thought I had her I know that she had me
And when we landed it was Paris France
Seemed like a nice place for some French romance
But when I touched her she said "Maybe a little later BB"
And that's the story everybody knows
We went to Berlin and to Stockholm too
And on the Moscow then to the Peking Zoo
As far as travel she couldn't get too much
Somewhere in Oakland she let me have just a little touch
And then she said "I'm late for beauty appointment
I've got a headache and I believe I'm coming down with the flu"
And that's the story everybody knows
