I've had everything

That money can buy

But still I'm so unhappy

That I could cry

Because I've never

Had peace of mind

People, in my lifetime



When you're in trouble

And all down and out

Then you'll find out

What it's all about

Then you'll realize

That peace of mind

Darling, is hard to find



I've been everywhere

Seen everything

But I only have myself to blame

For not realizing while

I was riding high

That happiness is something

Money can't buy



Oh, the things I haven't done, baby

Are very few

I've had my troubles

And good luck too

But I've never

Had peace of mind

Darling, in my lifetime



Oh, I've been everywhere

Seen everything

But I only have myself to blame

Oh, for not realizing while

I was riding high

That happiness is something

Money can't buy



Oh, the things I haven't done, baby

Are very few

Yes, I've had my troubles

And good luck too

But I've never

Had peace of mind

Darling, in my lifetime

Darling, in my lifetime
