I wonder about her, I wonder where she went from here
still wonder about her, but nothings comin in too clear
since she left me all alone my days go by like years

Well Im thinkin about her
and all the things she used to say
still Im thinkin about her
but somethings getting in the way
I remember when she told me
she would up and leave me someday

I drive around in circles through the city
just waitin for the lights to change
but right about when midnight hits me
moonlight gets me feelin kind of crazy

I wonder about her, does she still wear that same old ring
I still wonder about her and I know it aint no big thing
Well she left me all alone now
and Im just waiting for my phone to ring



Ive been dreaming about her,
I guess I never really knew,
that living without her was more than I could ever do
Because she aint comin back, no she aint comin back,
no she aint comin back
cause there's nothin left to come back to
