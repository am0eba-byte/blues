You're breaking my heart, baby

There ain't a damn thing I can do

You got me wringing my hands

And crying, baby

While you're breaking my heart in two

You know I just can't believe

I can't believe, baby

That you're doing the things you do



I can't believe, baby

I can't believe you would do me wrong

Please have mercy on me, baby

I want you to come on back

Come on back where you belong

I want you so bad

I want you so bad, baby

You know I need my lady home
