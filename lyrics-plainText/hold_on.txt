Turn out the light, sleep won't come

I think about what's going wrong

Lying so close, so alone

Please turn to me, I'm almost gone



Hold on, I feel our love is changing

Hold on, please don't let me disappear

Hold on, there's time to rearrange things

Hold on, I'm not me without you here



Put out your hand, touch desire

Where there's a spark, could be a fire

Open your arms, let me see

If there's still love in you for me



Hold on, I feel our love is changing

Hold on, please don't let me disappear

Hold on, there's time to rearrange things

Hold on, I'm not me without you here
