Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey mama look at little sis

Out in the backyard, playin' like this

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at little sister

Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister



What about the neighbors, what they gonna say

Stop little sister, gettin' carried away

Hey hey hey, look at little sister

Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister



Shakin' like a tree, rollin' like a log

Shakin' and a rollin' now, that ain't all

Hey hey hey, look at little sister

Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister



Shakin' like a tree, rollin' like a log

Shakin' and a rollin' now, that ain't all

Hey hey hey, look at little sister

Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister



What about the neighbors, what they gonna say

Stop little sister, gettin' carried away

Hey hey hey, look at little sister

Hey hey hey hey, look at little sister
