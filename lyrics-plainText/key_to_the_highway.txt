I've got the key to the highway

Feel I got to go

Gonna leave here running

Walking is both too slow



I'm going back to the border

Baby where I'm better known

Because you haven't done nothing baby

But draw the good man from home



When the moon peeps over the mountain

Little girl I'll be on my way

I'm gonna roll the highway until the break of day



Oh give me one more kiss darling

Just before I go

'Cause when I leave this time little girl

I won't be back no more



I've got the key to the highway

Little darling I got to go

I'm gonna leave here running

Walking is both too slow
