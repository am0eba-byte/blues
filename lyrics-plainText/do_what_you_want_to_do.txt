You think you're the only woman

Who can keep me satisfied

You think you're the only woman

Who can always keep me tied



But you don't know, baby

You don't know what I got in store for you

I'm gonna give up ev'rything, baby

You can do what you wanna do



I always took the naggin'

The accusation of doin' wrong

But I'm fed up with it, baby

Because my love is not that strong



You don't know, baby

You don't know what's in store for you

I'm gonna give up ev'rything, baby

You can do what you wanna do
