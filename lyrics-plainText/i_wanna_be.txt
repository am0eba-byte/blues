I wonder helplessly day by day

It's so much easier to run away

My mind is telling my body so

Never know which way to go



I'm always there for you baby

You let me see

If we can get closer everyday



I wanna be

Held by you

I wanna be

Touched by you

I wanna be

I wanna be loved by you

I wanna be

Anything you want me to



Don't mean nothing when you're growing old

Nobody knows what the future holds

I am left with a bitter taste

Turn away from that beautiful chase



I'm always there for you baby

You let me see

If we can get closer everyday



I wanna be

Held by you

I wanna be

Touched by you

I wanna be

I wanna be loved by you

I wanna be

Anything you want me to
