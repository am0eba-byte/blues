I walked all the way from Dallas Texas, people Im going
to Californ

All the way to Dallas, people Im going to Californ

My baby she left me

I wont be walkin no more



I told her Id be there Sunday morning, to take her to Sunday
school

Be there Sunday morning, to take her to Sunday school

Shes a good woman, she know my ways she know my rules



I got a girl for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Friday too

I got a girl for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Friday too

Dont look for me through the weekend, womens

I got to take my baby to Sunday school



I walked clean from Dallas, people Im going to
Californ

All the way to Dallas, people Im going to Californ

My baby she left me

I wont be walkin no more
