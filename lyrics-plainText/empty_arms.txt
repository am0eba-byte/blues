Your gonna miss me little darlin', the day that I'm gone

Your gonna miss me little baby, the day that I'm gone

Cause I'm leavin' in the mornin', won't be back at all



You have run me ragged baby, your own fault your on your own

You have run me ragged baby, your own fault your on your own

You didn't want me no way baby, 'till that other man was gone



You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms

You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms

But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms



Low down and dead, and all alone
