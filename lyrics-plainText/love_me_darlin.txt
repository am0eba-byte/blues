Well now tell me darlin' may I have a talk with you

Wo, tell me darlin' may I have a talk with you,

because it won't be long before our true love will be through

Wo, tell me darlin' am I right or am I wrong

I said tell me darlin' am I right or am I wrong

I'm determined to know little girl you comin' home

Come on home baby



Now now listen to me baby while I hold your hand,

don't want anything from you but be your lovin' man

Now tell me darlin' may I have a talk with you,

because the words I have to tell you they will linger through the
years

I love you honey
