If your problems

Won't go away

And you're worried

Both night and day

Hand it over

Get on your knees and pray



If you're sick

Feeling low

Got no money

Got nowhere to go

Hand it over

Get on your knees and pray



(Chorus:)

Hand it over

Hand it over

Give it up, give it over

Hand it over

Get on your knees and pray



(Bridge:)

Ain't no mountain

You cant climb

Ain't no answer

You can't find

All you need is a hand to hold

Ill heal your body

And feed your soul



If the road is dark

And you can`t find your way

Just let the spirit light the way

Hand it over

Get on your knees and pray



(Chorus)



(Bridge)



(Chorus)
