Oh momma, where's my daddy

Why don't he ever come around

Momma, where's my daddy

Is he nowhere to be found



Momma, where's my daddy

Can we call him on the phone

Does he ever think about us

Or does he have a heart of stone



Momma what's the matter

Why's there water in your eyes

Do you need him as much as I do

I love you momma, please don't cry



Where does he come from

What does he look like

Does he have a face like mine

Is he ever comin back here

And why'd he leave us all behind



Momma when did you and daddy get married

Was it in 19 and 83

Son, your daddy and I were married

But he just wasn't married to me



Oh momma, where's my daddy

Why don't he ever come around

Momma, where's my daddy

Is he nowhere to be found
