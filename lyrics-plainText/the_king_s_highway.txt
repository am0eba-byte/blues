Walkin' down,

the king's highway

A paper bag in my hand,

nothin' else but my clothes I got on

But I ain't a lookin' back,

I ain't a lookin' back



I blame it on that midnight girl,

a wicked spell she casts

She pulled me in with her lip but I,

but I ain't a lookin' back

I ain't a lookin' back



Oh what a tangle,

when she weeps

I was a losin' my mind,

starin' down the barrel of a gun

It's just a matter of time

Yeah
