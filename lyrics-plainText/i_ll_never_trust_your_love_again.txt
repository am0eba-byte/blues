I'll never, trust your love again

I'll never, never, trust your love again

You broke my heart in two baby

I'll never trust your love again



Seven days a week I worked for you baby, I gave you all I could
afford

Seven days a week I worked for you, I gave you all I could afford

I'd come home in the evening time, all you did was fuss and fight



Baby



I know I'll never, I'll never be the same no more

Never never, be the same no more

You keep me worried and bothered baby, and troubled all the time

I'm gonna leave
