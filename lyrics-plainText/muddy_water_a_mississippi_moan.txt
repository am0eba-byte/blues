Dixie
1
 moonlight, Swanee shore

Headed homebound just once more

To my Mississippi delta home

Southland has that grand garden spot

Although you believe or not

I hear those breeze a-whispering:

"Come on back to me"

Muddy water 'round my feet

Muddy water in the street

Just God don't shelter

Down on the delta

Muddy water in my shoes

Reeling and rocking to them lowdown blues

They live in ease and comfort down there

I do declare

Been away a year today

To wander and roam

I don't care it's muddy there

But see it is my home

Got my toes turned Dixie way

'Round the delta let me lay

My heart cries out for muddy water

Note: " "Muddy Water" is a great record despite the puerility of its
lyrics  it's a pop tune that, of all things, sentimentalizes
the recurrent Mississippi floods! Compare the guff about "Dixie
moonlight, Swanee shore" with the honest and compelling imagery of
Bessie's personal reaction to 
the
great Mississippi flood of the same year (1927)
, which she
experienced while on tour (see  or rather hear  Bessie's
"
Back
Water Blues
")". George Avakian;

Note 1: Dixie, name for the Southern states of the U.S. First used in
the song 
Dixie

(1859) by 
Daniel
D. Emmett
;

Note 2: Swanee, or Suwannee, a 250 miles (400 kilometers) long river
that flows from South-East Georgia & North Florida South-West
into the Gulf of Mexico.
