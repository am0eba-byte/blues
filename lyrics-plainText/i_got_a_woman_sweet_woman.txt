Lord, I've got a woman, she's sweet in every way I know

Lord, I've got a woman, she's sweet in every way I know

She don't want me to worry, she make evry' thing convenient you
know



Lord, she keeps me clean, oh boy she treats me kind

Oh, she keeps me clean, whoa boy she treats me kind

(Well alright!)

Well, she don't want me to worry, always want to pacify my mind



Lord, she don't want me to cry for nothin', she don't want me to sit
around an worry for a thing

Lord, she don't want me to cry for nothin', she don't want me to sit
around an worry for a thing

Before she stand to see me to worry, what she'll do, well, get out an
work for her man
