I come in last night about half past ten,

that baby of mine wouldn't let me in

So move it on over, rock it on over,

move over little dog, the mean old dog is movin' in



She told me not to mess around,

but I done let the deal go down

Move it on over, rock it on over,

move over nice dog, the big fat dog is movin' in



She changed the lock on my back door,

now my key won't fit no more

Move it on over, rock it on over,

move over nice dog, the mean old dog is movin' in



She threw me out just as pretty as she pleased,

pretty soon I'll be scratchin' fleas

Move it on over, slide it on over,

move over nice dog, the mean old dog is movin' in



Yeah, listen to me dog before you start to whine,

that side yours and this side mine

So move it on over, rock it on over,

move over little dog, the big old dog is movin' in



Yeah, she changed the lock on my back door,

now my key won't fit no more

Move it on over, rock it on over,

move over little dog, the big old dog is movin' in



Move it on over, move it on over

Move it on over, won't'cha rock it on over

Move over cool dog, the hot dog's movin' in
