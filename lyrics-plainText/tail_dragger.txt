I'm a tail dragger

I wipe out my tracks

When I get what I want

I don't come sneakin' back



The mighty wolf

Makin' a midnight creep

The hunters

They can't find him

Stealin' chicks everywhere he go

Then draggin' his tail behind



I'm a tail dragger

I wipe out my tracks

When I get what I want

Well I don't come sneakin' back



The 'cuda drags

His tail in the sand

The fish wiggles

His tail in the water

When the mighty wolf come a long

Draggin' his tail

He done sole somebody's daughter



I'm a tail dragger

I wipe out my tracks

When I get what I want

Well I don't come sneakin' back
