I've had everything that money can buy,

oh, but still I'm so unhappy darling, that I could cry

Because I've never had peace of mind, darling, in my life time



When you're in trouble and all down and out,

then you'll find out, darling, what it's all about

Then you'll realize that peace of mind, darling, is hard to find



I've been everywhere, seen everything but I only have myself to
blame,

for not realizing while I was riding high that happiness is something
money can't buy

Oh, the things I haven't done, darling, are mighty few

Yes, I've had trouble baby, and good luck too

Oh, but I've never had peace of mind, darling, in my life time
