When Im all alone, when Im feelin Blue
No one understands me, baby, nobody but you

Through all the sleepless nights, and the rainy day till the sun is nowhere in view
The only way I make it through is when I come to you,
and in my darkest hour, when the midnight shadows fall
Baby you got the power to make the angels come to call

I just hold you in my arms, and let music in my heart play the whole night through
When I come to you, I felt so brand new, when I come to you

When I come to you, you make it all right again
When I come to you, you keep me from the howlin wind,
and feel brand new, when I come to you
