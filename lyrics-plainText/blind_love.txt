People, I was standing at my window, tears running all down my
cheeks

Yes, standing at my window, tears running all down my cheeks

Well, I could see the woman I'm loving, stopping everyone in the
world she meets



Well, standing on the corner, between 35th and Main

Well, standing on the corner, people, between 35th and Main

Yeah, that's where a blind man's seen my woman, people, a dumb man
called her name



He said, "Oh, I'm blind, you brought eyesight and made me see"

"Oh, I'm blind, you brought eyesight and made me see"

Yes, and the dumb man asked a question, "Woman, who may your good man
be?"



Yes, I'm standing by trembling, people, people, my heart's laying in
my hand

I'm standing by trembling, darling, with my heart's laying in my
hand

Well, I could hear my baby say, "Lord, I ain't got no man"
