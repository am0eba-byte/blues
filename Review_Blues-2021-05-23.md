### Project orientation and research questions
This project has been a fun series of research questions from the start, from testing what thousands of blues lyrics we could draw from the worldwide web first of all, to learning more about performing artists and composers over the twentieth century, and tracking patterns in the language of blues lyrics. This was an ambitious project from the start, and one of the best things about it is that the research questions continue! Besides the excellent questions you present on the first page of your website, the ongoing questions include:

* Can we find more blues lyrics and add them to the archive you have organized? 
* Will the patterns you have found change significantly if we can find more lyrics from the 1920s - 40s? 

For a semester of work, what you accomplished was to learn about how to build a serious archive, and how to query it and study it and understand it, most importantly, for the incomplete thing that it is! I most appreciate your openness to pointing out the limitations of this work. That is what professional scholars and analysists and developers need to do: share their proof-of-concept and launch, and make plans on how to continue! 

### Analysis
Text analysis work is both technical and reflective, and your project excels in both of these areas. Not only did you succeed in generating some wonderful interactive network graphs and bar plots, but you took some care in thinking about what they show and what we can learn from them (and also of course about what they're missing). Perhaps the most complicated of your network graphs is the “Network of Interactions between Songwriters and Performing Artists”. You took some care with visualizing this so we can easily discover the performers and explore which songwriters they shared in common. Your explanation of how to read the network is super clear and easy to follow, so this makes a helpful discovery tool for people interested in the 20th-century history of the blues. 

I appreciate how thoughtful you were about finding angles from which to interrogate your data. You asked lots of questions of your data set, and that means you made the most of the care you took in curating it. Since we could isolate music by decades, it makes sense to break down the natural language processing research decade by decade, and see what you could see. The result was that sudden illumination of “baby” as popular from the 1930s onward, but not in the 1920s. Maybe not—and I wonder if that will change when we find more to add to your collection. One question we could also ask is, what happens to the relative popularity of adult words like “man” and “woman” over those decades of blues writing?

### Website design and user experience
This site is built to deliver visualizations from the opening page and to invite visitors to explore and interact and think. In the “Our Methods” section, I would love to see a code block of one song to show your XML markup that is organizing the project, since it would be easy to see how the pieces fit together that organize your queries. (You could use a `<pre>` element to paste in the code for one representative song and HTML will preserve the spaces. You just have to find and replace the `<` and `>` characters so they don't read as code.) 

It's good that you feature your code for querying the files in your GitHub repo, but you could probably add some commentary about anything that made the querying a little tricky. (For example, we did have a little “string surgery” to do to help organize the songs by decade, after all, and it's something our little community of coding students might benefit from learning over your shoulders down the road!) There's no need to explain every last thing, but finding some moments of interest to feature in the coding process would be a good addition to this project site. 

### Concluding comments
You have built a project you can be very proud of, and that is already illuminating for other students what amazing things you can do with a coding project! I was happy to be learning right alongside you this semester as the Blues project came together, and I'm eager to see it continue. One thing that's a little humbling about a project like this is it may never feel complete! After all, the Blues are immense and have long oral tradition that print and text never could capture. The best we can do is keep searching for the missing parts. And I think the key thing to learn is that a visualization can show us where you are in a process, what parts you're missing. So, a serious project like yours can point the way to its own future!
