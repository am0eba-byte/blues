<BR>
Now I walked into a beer tavern<BR>
To give a girl a nice time<BR>
When I entered I had forty-five dollars<BR>
When I left I had one dime<BR>
<BR>
Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
Don't you know, man don't you know<BR>
She was a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
I don't want to see her no more<BR>
<BR>
Now when I spent down to my last dime<BR>
She says, "Daddy I know you're not through"<BR>
I told her, "Yes, baby doll and the diploma belongs to you"<BR>
<BR>
Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
Don't you know, man don't you know<BR>
She was a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
And I don't want to see her no more<BR>
<BR>
She would often say, "Excuse me a minute,<BR>
I've got to step around here"<BR>
And every time she'd come back<BR>
She'd say, "I want another quart of beer"<BR>
<BR>
Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
Don't you know, man don't you know<BR>
Boy, she was the toughest I met<BR>
Lord, she was a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
I don't want to see her no more<BR>
<BR>
I say, "I've got to step off baby,<BR>
anything else you would like?"<BR>
She said, "Daddy I'll keep this table,<BR>
If you promise me you'll be back"<BR>
<BR>
You know that was a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
Don't you know, man don't you know?<BR>
She was a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
I don't wanna see her no more<BR>
<BR>
I says, "I'm sorry baby, but I only have one more dime"<BR>
She said, "Daddy buy me a small bottle of beer,<BR>
so I can concentrate my mind"<BR>
<BR>
Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman?<BR>
Don't you know, man don't you know<BR>
Lord, she was a beer drinkin' woman<BR>
I don't wanna see her no more<BR>
