<BR>
I've been wrong, wrong for so long<BR>
Living life like this, I just can't go on<BR>
Without a helping hand,<BR>
I just can't seem to find my way<BR>
So I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days<BR>
Better Days<BR>
<BR>
Now I said a prayer last night,<BR>
when my day was through<BR>
That I could live my life,<BR>
the way the Lord would want me to<BR>
'Cause without a helping hand,<BR>
I just can't seem to find my way<BR>
So I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days<BR>
Better Days<BR>
<BR>
Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours<BR>
'Cause there's a pain in my heart<BR>
Oh that I've just got to cure<BR>
Please, please baby won't you take me in<BR>
There's been too many times I needed to find a true friend<BR>
Say you'll always, always tell the truth to me<BR>
'Cause there's been too many times,<BR>
that I've been lied to and deceived,<BR>
and somehow I got lost, and now I can't find my way<BR>
Oh I guess I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days<BR>
Better Days<BR>
<BR>
Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours<BR>
'Cause there's a pain in my heart<BR>
Oh that I've just got to cure,<BR>
and somehow I got lost, and now I can't find my way<BR>
Oh I guess I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days<BR>
Better Days<BR>
