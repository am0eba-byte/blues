<BR>
My wife has a charge card<BR>
Well, I got it the other day<BR>
I owe five hundred dollars<BR>
Yes, just for yesterday<BR>
<BR>
I said, "Honey, here's a present,<BR>
go out an' shop around,<BR>
get a couple a-dresses,<BR>
an' browse around downtown"<BR>
<BR>
She did just what I told her,<BR>
bought one, two or three<BR>
Then came home lookin' silly<BR>
Makin' goo-goo eyes at me<BR>
<BR>
Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card<BR>
Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card<BR>
Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card<BR>
<BR>
I said, "Did you get your dresses?"<BR>
She said, "Yes, one or two,<BR>
but I had to get me some shoes,<BR>
an' I needed some jewelry, too"<BR>
<BR>
She had two hundred dollar dresses<BR>
That I could-a made, an' I can't sew<BR>
Fifty dollar pair a shoes,<BR>
an' I thought you so an' so<BR>
<BR>
Said, "What about the jewelry?"<BR>
As calmly as I could<BR>
She said, "Honey, you'll love them,<BR>
they're pure, African wood"<BR>
<BR>
Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card<BR>
Mastercharge (mastercharge, heh-heh), I'll break an' bury her
card<BR>
Mastercharge (go mastercharge on the thing), I'll break an' bury her
card<BR>
<BR>
Let's charge it, let's charge it!<BR>
<BR>
"They were two hundred dollars, an' I paid one an' a half!"<BR>
<BR>
I just didn't believe it, so mad, I just had to laugh<BR>
I could see in my mind, on a horse like Paul Revere<BR>
I hate to check my mailbox, 'cause these bills keep comin' here<BR>
<BR>
Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card<BR>
Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card<BR>
Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card<BR>
<BR>
Yeah, run up all my bills<BR>
"Charge it!"<BR>
Ev'ry time I look around, it's "charge, charge!"<BR>
<BR>
"Let's charge it!"<BR>
All she can say<BR>
<BR>
"A let's charge it!"<BR>
"Mastercharge!"<BR>
"Oh, I have a Mastercharge!"<BR>
"Oh, I have a BankAmericard, too!"<BR>
"Mastercharge!"<BR>
"Oh, would you mind chargin' it, please?"<BR>
<BR>
Now don't you get too much on it, now<BR>
Get too much chargin', now<BR>
<BR>
"Let's charge it!"<BR>
<BR>
