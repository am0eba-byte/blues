</FONT>Way back in the nineteen hundred and ten<BR>
The monkey and the baboon, they came walkin' in<BR>
The monkey told the baboon, "Let's shoot a game a pool"<BR>
The monkey could shoot, but the baboon wasn't no fool<BR>
<BR>
Next thing came along was a little mule<BR>
He said, "You know I'm so mad, I even can't wear no shoe"<BR>
Next thing came along, there was Mr. Cat<BR>
"We ain't gonna have no such a-stuff goin' on here like that"<BR>
Next thing came, was a little mouse,<BR>
"Let's all get drunk an' break up this doggone house"<BR>
<BR>
Can't you read, now can't you read<BR>
If you keep on readin' I'm bound to put you out<BR>
<BR>
Well, the monkey an' the elephant, they went out for a little
drive<BR>
The elephant hit the monkey right square in his eye<BR>
The monkey looked up with a tear an' a sigh<BR>
Said, "Look at here big boy, you oughta get someone your size,<BR>
One of these days I'm gonna climb your tree,<BR>
Remember big boy you gotta march right under me"<BR>
"When you march under me, you better march careful 'n fast,<BR>
I'll get me a limb an' break it 'cross your...<SUP>1</SUP><BR>
<BR>
Now can't you read, now can't you read<BR>
If you keep on readin', I'm bound to put you out<BR>
<BR>
If anybody just happen to ask you<BR>
Where the weddin' gonna be?<BR>
Come right down there on Hazen street<BR>
Cold down there just about the end of the week<BR>
You can get most anything that you care to eat<BR>
If you don't like shrimp, just name your dish<BR>
They'll even serve you some a that ol' fillet fish<BR>
<BR>
Now can't you read, now can't you read<BR>
If you keep on reading, mama, I'm bound to put you out<BR>
<BR>
Yeah, play it Mr. Maceo! (piano)<BR>
<BR>
Well, fifteen cents you know that's the regular price<BR>
If you got two fifteen, we'll even serve you twice<BR>
Can't you read, now can't you read<BR>
If you keep on reading, I'm bound to put you out<BR>
<BR>

Note: vocals by Big Maceo and Tampa Red;<BR>
Note 1: "The last line in the 3rd verse is missing a word at the end
on purpose. The word is "ass" but he doesn't sing it (rhymes with
fast) and I guess the listener is suppose to fill in the blank. Can
you imagine they didn't sing "bad words" back then?", Anita Cantor
