I just had to get out on the Texas plane, Lord, well it was bringing
me down<BR>
Yeah, I had to get out of Texas, baby, Lord, it was bringing me
down<BR>
I been all around the world, but Port Arthur is the worst place that
I've ever found<BR>
<BR>
I guess they couldn't understand it there, honey, they'd laugh me off
the street!<BR>
Lord, I guess they couldn't understand me, baby, honey, they'd laugh,
I said they'd laugh me right off the street, yeah<BR>
I said I want to keep on moving, baby, be the last person I ever
wanna meet<BR>
<BR>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, honey ain't it hard when you're all alone<BR>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, honey ain't it hard, Lord, when you're
all alone<BR>
I might die real old lady, but I'd never call Texas my home, no, no,

You say you come from Texas, baby, she says she left Texas with just
her name<BR>
(Spoken: That's what she told me)<BR>
Yes she's from Texas I tell you, she says she left Texas with just
her name<BR>
Yes, well I swear when that girl came to the big city, Lord, she
learned a brand new game<BR>
Well, yeah!<BR>
<BR>
Honey, I hear you talkin' about sorrow, baby but you don't know my
pain, that's right!<BR>
Mercy! Mercy!<BR>
I hear you talking about my sorrow, you don't know my pain<BR>
You know there's an inside kind of sorrow, Lord, the women are always
singin' the blues<BR>

You know I, I dealt the Ace to the Queen, you know I played scrabble
with L.B.J.<BR>

scrabble with L.B.J.<BR>
Well, I don't care what the name of the game is, baby, I tell you I
always seem to get my way<BR>

I used to be a doggone fool, fall for a woman's story every time<BR>
But no more, I swear<BR>
Well, I used to be a, be a doggone fool, fall for that old woman's
story every time<BR>
Yes I, I'm a big boy now, yeah, they gotta come up with some kind of
heavy line<BR>
