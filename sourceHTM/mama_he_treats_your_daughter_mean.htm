Mama he takes all my money<BR>
Makes me call him honey<BR>
<BR>
I've stood all that I can stand<BR>

I said mama he treats your daughter so mean<BR>
Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean<BR>
Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen<BR>

I said mama he treats your daughter so mean<BR>
Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean<BR>
Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen<BR>
<BR>
Oh I said mama I'm so disgusted<BR>
He just can't be trusted<BR>
Mama he makes me squeeze him<BR>
Oh tell mama my squeezes just don't please him<BR>
<BR>
I've stood all I can stand<BR>
Gonna pack my bags and leave this man<BR>
<BR>
I said mama he treats your daughter so mean<BR>
Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean<BR>
He's the meanest man I've ever seen<BR>
Lord, No, Now!<BR>
<BR>
Got to find a good man<BR>
Oh I said mama I'm tired of this man of mine<BR>
I got to find me a good man baby<BR>
Find me a good man now<BR>
Find me a good man baby<BR>
I got to find me a good man, oh yes!<BR>
I got to find me a good man now<BR>
I need a good man<BR>
One that's gonna treat me right<BR>
And oh one that's gonna come home at night<BR>
I don't want a man that fuss and fights<BR>
Oh, I said mama, mama, he treats, your daughter, mean<BR>
