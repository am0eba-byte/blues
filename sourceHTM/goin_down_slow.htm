(spoken:<BR>
Alright, alright.<BR>
Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen right here,<BR>
right here I want to tell you a little story.<BR>
This is about a country boy from down home.<BR>
This young man has never been north before.<BR>
I want you to listen to me, I got something to tell you.<BR>
<BR>
He heard about Chicago.<BR>
He worked hard over here, made all of that money, 800 dollars.<BR>
After caring for his crop, he called his cousin in Chicago,<BR>
and he said, "Cousin, I'm on my way".<BR>
He picked all of that cotton.<BR>
I said this is about a country boy like myself, B.B. King you
know.<BR>
So when he get to Chicago, his cousin meet him and bring him out to
the club.<BR>
He said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for.<BR>
Had all the go-go girls set up, waitin' up.<BR>
They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the pleasure
hotels.<BR>
They brought him back out and said, "Set him up!", cous's payin'
for.<BR>
His money got a little lighter, they lured him out from the Lute and
brought him down to Robert's.<BR>
And then he said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for.<BR>
And then the 800 dollars, bein' more money then my man had ever had,
began to run out.<BR>
Then they moved him out and put him down with the ...<BR>
And then, ladies and gentlemen, the go-go girls would get fewer.<BR>
His friends was fewer.<BR>
All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other side of the
street.<BR>
And then it happened all his buddies were gone.<BR>
And my man knew only one thing to do, it was getting cold there, like
it is today,<BR>
you know what I'm talking about.<BR>
He went down to the railroad yard,<BR>
and one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent his money,
came by to see him.<BR>
And she said "You fool!, you fool!", I wouldn't have spend your
money, but the rest of them was spending your money so I decided to
spend my portion too, you know.<BR>
But ladies, God bless 'em, wonderful something's aren't they?.<BR>
They always like to feel like they're needed, and she knew my man
needed her bad.<BR>
He gotten sick, he's layin' down there under the boxcar.<BR>
Couldn't read so well, so you know if he couldn't read so well, he
couldn't write too well,<BR>
you know what I'm talkin' about?<BR>
So this is a letter back down home, I know what I'm talkin'
about.<BR>
It go like this:)<BR>
<BR>
I've had my fun, whoah, if I don't get well no more<BR>
Whoah, I've had my fun, people, ooh, if I don't get well no more<BR>
Yes, my health is faillin' on me now, people<BR>
Ooh, and I'm goin', goin' down slow<BR>
<BR>
Yes, tell my mother, people, please tell her the shape I'm in<BR>
Ooh yes, tell my people, mother, tell her the shape I'm in<BR>
Tell her to pray for me, people, ooh, to forgive, people, my sins<BR>
<BR>
Oohooh mother, mother I live alone with my prayers<BR>
Ooh, tell my mother, people, tell her this is all in prayers<BR>
Yes, if you don't see this old body, mother<BR>
Hey, you know I'm out in the world somewhere<BR>
<BR>
