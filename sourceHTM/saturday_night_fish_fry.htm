<BR>
Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans<BR>
Then you can understand just what I mean<BR>
All thru the week it's quiet as a mouse<BR>
But on Saturday night they go from house to house<BR>
You don't have to pay the usual admission<BR>
If you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician<BR>
So if you happen to be just passin' by<BR>
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry<BR>
<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
<BR>
Now my buddy and me was on the main stem<BR>
Foolin' around just me and him<BR>
We decided we could use a little something to eat<BR>
So we went to a house on Rampart Street<BR>
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease<BR>
And a lush little Miss said, "Come in, please"<BR>
And before we could even bat an eye<BR>
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry<BR>
<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
<BR>
Now the folks was havin' the time of their life<BR>
And Sam was jivin' Jimmie's wife<BR>
Over in the corner was a beat up grand<BR>
Being played by a big fat piano man<BR>
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks<BR>
Some of them had on bobbie socks<BR>
But everybody was nice and high<BR>
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry<BR>
<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
<BR>
Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'<BR>
The bottles was flyin', and the fish was smellin'<BR>
And way above all the noise we made<BR>
Somebody hollered, "You better get outta here, this is a raid!"<BR>
I didn't know we was breaking the law but<BR>
Somebody reached over and hit me on the jaw<BR>
Now they had us blocked off from front to back<BR>
And they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potatoes in a sack<BR>
<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
<BR>
I knew I could get away if I had a chance<BR>
But I was shakin' like I had the St. Vitus dance<BR>
So I tried to crawl in under a bath tab<BR>
When a policeman said, "Where are you goin' there, bub?"<BR>
Now they got us out of there like a house on fire<BR>
And put us all in the black Maria<BR>
Now they might have missed a pitiful few<BR>
But they got both me and my buddy too<BR>
<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
<BR>
Well we headed for jail in a dazed condition<BR>
They booked each one of us on suspicion<BR>
Now my chick came down and paid my bail<BR>
And finally got me outta that rotten jail<BR>
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye<BR>
Just mention a Saturday Night Fish Fry<BR>
I don't care how many fish in the sea<BR>
But don't ever mention a fish to me<BR>
<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
It was rockin', it was rockin'<BR>
You never seen such scufflin'<BR>
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn<BR>
