                <p class="researchQs">In honor of the many legends of the blues, our project team
                    gathered our vast collection of blues lyrics from various foundational blues
                    artists to conduct intriguing analysis on various aspects of the blues.</p>
                <div class="research"><p class="research">Our primary research questions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="research">How many of the blues songs from our collection were written and performed by the
                    same artist?</li>
                    <li class="research">How many original songs are widely shared across many different perfomring artists? 
                    </li>
                    <li class="research">What is the decade range of our blues song collection?
                    </li>
                    <li class="research">How many blues artists in our collection have written songs which outlived them, or at least their
                    own performances?</li>
                    <li class="research">Which artists and songwriters tend to be interconnected the most? (Performer/Songwriter relationship patterns)</li>
                    <li class="research">Are there key words or phrases that tend to be used frequently across our collection of lyrics? What are they,
                    and what are their origins or significance to the blues genre?</li>
