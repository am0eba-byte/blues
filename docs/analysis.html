                                <p class="method">Once we had all relevant data and formatting
                                    tagged in our collection, we used the eXist software to create
                                    and conduct XQueries which could pull and query the information
                                    we were after from our XML tags en masse using XPath functions.
                                    Once we had functioning XQueries, we used the FLWOR method of
                                    XQuerying to create SVG graphics, collections of raw text files
                                    for Python, and TSV (Tab-Separated Values) files from the
                                    queried data. From these, we created visualizations of our

                            <p>This network, created in Cytoscape, utilizes all of our <code>"artist"</code> and <code>"songwriter"</code> tags
                            in our collection of 1,088 song XML files to create a visualization of the shared interactions between
                            <span class="artists">performing artists</span> (big blue circles/rectangles) and <span class="songwrit">songwriters</span> (large and small pink squares) as they
                            are connected through songs. Each connecting line represents song(s) - the direction of the line's arrows
                            shows who wrote the song(dotted end), and who performed it(arrow end).</p>
                            <p>The larger pink squares represent <span class="songwrit">songwriters</span> who connect two of more performing artists together - 
                            meaning that those people wrote songs which were performed by two or more performing artists in our collection.</p>
                            <p>The red lines indicate <span class="songs">songs</span> that were written by a performing artist orignially, and were covered
                            by one or more other performing artists.</p>
                            <p>This network alone shows the massive amount of blues songs that have been passed down and shared among 
                            blues artists, in our limited collection alone.</p>
                            <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> This network does not accurately represent ALL of the interactions between
                            blues artists and songwriters throughout the whole genre. This network's dataset is limited to our 
                            source files, which is <a href="source.html">far from being fully representative or complete data of the blues.</a> This accounts for
                            why B.B. King's songwriter connections is so much bigger than the others' - it's not that B.B. King ACTUALLY 
                            has more songs which connect him to more songwriters - our collection simply has a disproportionate amount of 
                            his songs, compared to the other artists in our collection. In the future we hope to add more song files from 
                            our artists and other blues artists we have no songs for, to create a more representative network for the blues as a whole!</p>

                        <p class="method">In order to compare aspects of the blues lyrics themselves
                            within our collection, we used Python and spaCy's Natural Language
                            Processor (NLP) to auto-magically analyze any collection of lyrics we
                            give it and find parts of speech, entities, and the like within each
                            line and produce beautiful bar graphs using pyGal. </p>
                        <p class="method">For our purposes, we used the NLP to create visual
                            graphics of the most common nouns, verbs, and geopolitical entities
                            within songs which were written and performed in each decade. In doing
                            so, we created a marvelous visual for what sorts of things blues music
                            was serenading about, what topics or subjects may have been a
                            popular/common hardship to have the (emotional) blues over at the time,
                            and in the case of the geopolitical entities graphs, where these artists
                            were emotionally experiencing and musically sharing the blues from.</p>

                                most common geopolitical enities mentioned and most common names of people mentioned within all of our song lyrics.</p>
                                <p>While our collection is indeed limited, it's interesting to contemplate why places such as Chicago, Texas, New Orleans, and Tennessee
                                are mentioned most often in our blues songs. It could be that many of the songs were written and/or performed in these places,
                                and it's reasonable to conclude that they were referenced so many times in our collection of blues songs due to
                                hardships being endured in these places most often. It could also be argued that these places are mentioned most often
                                because they are sung about in a positive light - maybe these are places that blues artists and songwriters
                                wished to escape <em>to,</em> instead of <em>from.</em></p>
                                <p>The graph representing most common names of people mentioned within our collection's lyrics is harder to decipher - there are 
                                a number of reasons why these names in particular were mentioned so many times throughout songs. The fact that half of these names are presumably female
                                may relfect that many of these blues songs were expressing the woes of heartbreak, and it's possible that these female
                                names are used as a general reference to a significant other. It's also fascinating that Uncle Sam is on this list - as it 
                                reflects how many of our collection's songs were written to express the woes and neglect brought upon by America's government to
                                many of our collecton's artists and songwriters at the time.</p>
                                <p><b>NOTE:</b> Again, this graph is not comprehensive. Some work was done to fix bugs that spaCy created when formulating these
                                entity word frequencies - there may be some inaccuracies, beyond the fact that our dataset itself is incomprehensive.</p>
