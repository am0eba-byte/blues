                        archive,</a> chock-full of blues lyrics, created in 1999. Shockingly, we
                    would've had thousands more song lyric files to markup and create intriguing
                    data from if it wasn't for the unfortunate "link rot" which plagued this whole
                    site archive - the majority of the links to song lyrics pages became obsolete
                    and therefore dysfunctional as HTML standards outgrew this outmoded goldmine of
                    an archival website. As such, much work was done to scrape the text from every
                    song lyric page possible and clean them all of their ancient HTML code to
                    produce clean, uniform text files to conduct our analyses.</p>
