Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin



That casket, it looked like a fine Seville,

he had a vanity license and a cadillac grille

Willie was propped up in the driver's seat,

Fine red suit had the whole town talkin',

talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin

Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin



Oh, cadillac to heaven he was wavin' the banner,

A wall of denial, is fallin' down

Wo it's fallin' so hard, own to the ground

Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears,

but this wall of denial was just built on fear



We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies,

dressed them amused them pullin' wool over our eyes

Go so far as to love them to keep from letting them go,

all the while they we're killin' us but we couldn't let it show



No matter what the trouble we carry round inside,

we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive

When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down,

down to the ground



Simple things in life bring the greatest pleasure,

a smile, a kiss, a little baby's laughter

It makes no difference if we run away in fear,

the little things in life hold us so near



No matter what the trouble we carry round inside,

we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive

When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down

Yeah, this wall of denial must tumble down

Down to the groundWell I'm standin' next to a mountain, Chopin' down with the

Went down to Tin Pan Alley, see what was going on

Things was too hot down there, couldn't stay very long

Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

Hey, Hey, Hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

Yeah they took me away from tin pan alley

And took me right back, to the pen




Caught up in a whirlwind can't catch my breath,

knee deep in hot water broke out in a cold sweat

Can't catch a turtle in this rat race,

feels like I'm losin' time at a breakneck pace



Afraid of my own shadow in the face of grace,

heart full of darkness spotlight on my face

There was love all around me but I was lookin' for revenge,

thank God it never found me would have been the end



I was walkin' the tightrope steppin' on my friends

Walkin' the tightrope it was a shame and a sin

Walkin' the tightrope between wrong and right

Walkin' the tightrope both day and night



Lookin' back in front of me in the mirror's a grin,

through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend

We've all had our problems that's the way life is,

my heart goes out to others who are there to make amends



We've been walkin' the tightrope tryin' to make it right

Walkin' the tightrope every day and every night

Walkin' the tightrope bring it all around

Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found



Walkin' the tightrope stretched around the world

Walkin' the tightrope save the boys and girls

Walkin' the tightrope let's make it right

Walkin' the tightrope do it do it tonight

Walkin' the tightrope




One night while sleeping in my bed I had a beautiful dream

That all the people of the world got together on the same
wavelength,

and began helping one another

Now in this dream, universal love was the theme of the day

Peace and understanding and it happened this way



The sick, the hungry, had smiles on their faces,

the tired and the homeless had family all around

The streets and the cities were all beautiful places,

and the walls came tumblin' down



People of the world all had it together,

had it together for the boys and the girls

And the children of the world look forward to a future

the worst of enemies became the best of friends

had it together for the boys and the girls

Children of the world look forward to a future

You'll know about that, baby, baby that I love you soIt's hard to be

It's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby

Can't you see, when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me
crazy

Something inside of me, when she's gone I miss her so

I wanna tell her how I feel, just gotta let her know

When I'm alone with her, and she's in my arms I'm in heaven



It's all I see, in my dreams, we'll be happy together

Side by side, I hope that our love will stay this way forever

Something inside of me, got a feelin' that won't let go

I wanna tell her how I feel, I just gotta let her know

Lookin' through her eyes, I see a paradise, no mistake she's full of

fire




Like a real live wire, a house on fire

She's my burnin', she's my burnin', burnin' desire

Well it's hard to be, it's hard for me to keep arm's length from my
baby

Oh can't you see, when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me
crazy

Something inside of me, when she's gone I miss her so

I wanna tell her how I feel, I just gotta let her know



When I'm alone with her, and she's in my arms I'm in heaven

Like a real live wire, a house on fire

She's my burnin', she's my burnin', burnin' desire

Hard to be, it's hard for me

It's hard to keep, keep me from my babySay things to me like a cowgirl would,

I'll do tricks for you like a cowboy should

You look romantic layin' in the hay,

I need you tonight in a new kind-a way

When you look at me with those eyes,

it makes me start to fantasize



Do it to me like I know you could,

so I can do it to you baby like a Texan should



Ridin' the range I think of you,

I dig your chili you know it's true

Make big money put it in the bank,

that longhorn caddy got a great big tank



Do it to me like I know you could,

so I can do it to you baby like a Texan should



Well you're the kind-a woman who's above the rest,

well nothing for me but the best

You say you need a fella who really can,

do it to you good like a Texan man



Massive wardrobe of cowboy clothes,

top of my head to the tip of my toes

Ah, you look so good in my hat with fringe on it,

so put on my boots hmmm doggone it



Do it to me like I know you could,

I do it to you like a Texan should

Do it to me baby like I know you could,

so I can do it to you baby like a good Texan should




Your gonna miss me little darlin', the day that I'm gone

Your gonna miss me little baby, the day that I'm gone

Cause I'm leavin' in the mornin', won't be back at all



You have run me ragged baby, your own fault your on your own

You have run me ragged baby, your own fault your on your own

You didn't want me no way baby, 'till that other man was gone



You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms

You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms

But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms



Low down and dead, and all aloneTrue love is gone, I's been played for a fool

True love is gone, I's been played for a fool

I'm turnin' the tables on you

You've been playin' dirty pool



You said you'd call the shots darlin',

all your friends thought that was cool, so cool baby

You said you'd call the shots darlin',

all your friends thought that was so cool

Yeah, when you shot at the eight-ball baby,

I knew you were playin' dirty pool



They say that life, life is a game of give and take

They say that life, life is a game of give and take

I'm tellin' you one thing right now little baby,

I won't be the one to pay for your mistake




Day by day night after night,

blinded by the neon lights

Hurry here hustlin' there,

no one's got the time to spare

Money's tight nothin' free,

won't somebody come and rescue me

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

Stranded, caught in the crossfire



Tooth for tooth eye for an eye,

sell your soul just to buy buy buy

Beggin' a dollar stealin' a dime,

come on can't you see that I

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire



I need some kind of kindness,

some kind of sympathy oh no

We're stranded, caught in the crossfire



Save the strong lose the weak,

never turning the other cheek

Trust nobody don't be no fool,

whatever happened to the golden rule

We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

Stranded, caught in the crossfire

Help me








Runnin' through this business of life,

rarely time if I'm needed to

Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right,

then daddy's hand helps to see me through

Sweet as sugar love won't wash away,

rain or shine, it always here to stay

All these years you and I've spent together,

all this, we just couldn't stand the weather



Like a train that stops at every station,

we all deal with trials and tribulations

Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years,

entangled in yellow and cries all his tears

Changes come before we can grow,

learn to see them before we're too old

Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy,

understand, it's time to get ready for the storm








People talkin' but they just don't know,

what's in my heart and why I love you so

I love you baby like a miner loves gold,

come on baby let the good times roll



Let the good times roll,

come on it soothes my soul

Oh let the good times roll,

come on, come on, come on



A lot of people live in make believe,

they keep a lot of dirt up their sleeve

My love baby ain't the kind to fold,

come on baby let the good times roll

Let the good times roll,

come on an' let it roll

Ah yeah, let it roll, come on, let it roll



Our lovin's nice if it's understood,

it's even nicer when you feel so good

You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole,

come on sugar let the good times roll



Oh let the good times roll,

come on let it roll, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on and let it rollOnce was a sweet thing baby, held out her lovin' in our
hands

Now I reach to kiss your lips, the touch don't mean a thing

And that's a cold shot baby, yeah, that's a drag

A cold shot baby, I let our love go bad



Remember the way that you loved me, do anything I said

Now I see you out somewhere, you won't give me the time of day

And that's a cold shot darlin', yeah that's a drag

And that's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad



I really meant I was sorry, for ever causin' you pain

You showed your appreciation, by walkin' out anyway

And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag

And that's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad



So sad, too bad, so sad

Don't let our true love run cold baby

'til you don't know what to say or doYou can't change it,

can't rearrange it

If time is all that we got

then baby let's take it



Lovin' is a lovin',

the moment is a-right

It's worth all the years in the past,

let's go one more night



Get away from the blind side of life

Honey I want you to be by my side

Me and my back door moves ain't no more,

no more



Get away from the blind side of life

Honey I want you to be by my side

Me and my back door moves ain't no more,

It's time we got movin', time to move on

Let's slide out the door, let's slide out the door

Ride our way home, let's glide our way home

You know some will like to argue, every time they take a drink

I don't have time to do either one if our love is on the blink

Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

Put my money on my honey, cash on delivery



Ah special delivery, return so many line

You know special delivery return, too many line

Make it C.O.D., oh, C.O.D.




Look up on the wall baby,

hand me down my shootin' iron

Look up on the wall baby,

Call your mother long distance,

tell her to expect your body home



If the city don't bury you baby,

Lord knows the county will

Wo the love I miss lovin', all the kiss I miss kissin'

love won't give up on me

I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

love ain't gone 'n' give up on me

Every tear that I've cried,

only washed away the fear inside

Now I, I ain't gone 'n' give up on love



Every beat of my heart,

pounds with joy and not with pain

Every beat of my heart,

pounds with joy and not in vain

And although those are painful memories,

only brought me to my knees

I was just given up on love



Little Johnny Taylor told us so long ago

What about the midnight cryin',

wo that cheatin' and lyin'

What about the price that will,

oh surely be paid

Those that gave up on love,

love will have it's day

I ain't givin' up on love



I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

love won't give up on me

I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

love won't give up on me

Every time I cry, love just won't let me be,

won't set me free
