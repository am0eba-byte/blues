No rocket's gonna fly that high

There's no escaping the enemy he's you and I

We poison up our water, we're chokin' on the air

Last stop before it gets too late or is it already too late?

Is it already too late

For the victims of comfort?

Got no one else to blame

We're just the victims of comfort

We cannot soothe the pain



And it's a technological merry-go-round

Dangerous solutions buried under the ground

And everyone likes a party

But no-one wants to clean

Well I'd like to see a change somehow and I believe we're busy right
now

Just a little busy right now

I am just a victim of comfort

I got no one else to blame

I'm just a victim of comfort

Cryin' shame



Boy what have we got to lose? Everything

Yes and what do we stand to gain? Everything, so let's

Try together before we have to cry together

It's too soon to die together

I'm just a victim of comfort

Got no one else to blame

I'm just a victim of comfort

Got to soothe the pain

Be the victims of comfort

Got no one else to blame

I am just a victim of comfort

Cryin' shameRemember when we first met

I was so excited just to get to know you

Oh baby just to know you

I was just a little bit shy

God willing I was ready

To try to show you

Oh just to show you



I felt a little funny

But it was really no joke

I wanted to prove my love

In every word that I spoke



(Chorus:)

But the action

Speaks louder

You know the action

Speaks louder than

The word

The action,

Louder than the word



I loved you just the way you were

Somehow I had to find the nerve to tell you

Oh baby just to tell you

So I did what a man must do

I walked right over to you

And I was asking

Baby, lets go dancing



I felt a little guilty

But I had committed no crime

I wanted to love you

Love you and love you

For a long time



(Chorus)



(Bridge:)

I can't wait until I'm holding you

And there's no doubt in your mind

You're the one and only one for me

Only one for me



I'm gonna prove my love no matter how long that it takes

The feelings I have for you they're no mistake



(Chorus)It ain't you

No it ain't me

That's not the way

Love's supposed to be



And it's just no good

No it ain't right

For you to be sitting all alone

Crying every night



You're down on your knees

Scared he's gonna leave

But if you really wanna know

You're gonna have to let go



Cause that's not love

Love don't feel that bad

That's not love

It don't feel that sad

No that's not love

'Cause you don't feel good inside

I don't know what it is

But that's not love



Inside your heart

It's always raining

And you're oh so tired

Tired of your own complaining



This is for real

It ain't no game

You can't measure your love

By the depths of your painStandin' at the station

Teardrops in my eyes

Standin' at the station

Wonderin' why

You love him more than you love me

You wanna marry him

Make a family

That's why I'm standin' at the station

Teardrops in my eyes



Well I'm standin' at the station

Sad as a man can be

And you're gazing through the window

Waving good-bye to me

Well I know you got to do what you got to do

But you're leaving me

And I'm loving you

That's why I'm standin' at the station

Teardrops in my eyes

Yes I'm standin' at the station

Teardrops in my eyes

Come back home baby, I need ya

Stop that train, back it on upRing-a-ling with the telephone

Is the man of the house home

Your master card is overdue

We need a payment from you

Right now

Right away

I ain't got nothing to send you today

But I'm gonna give you all your money

Soon as I get paid



The joint was jumping

It was Saturday night

Her hair was long

And her dress was tight

I looked at her

She looked at me

And the champagne started flowing

Till a quarter to three

Look Mr. Bartender

I'm gonna make it okay

Ill give you all your money

Soon as I get paid



Monday morning

Money's gone

It's a doggone shame

Don't worry

Ill get you straight

We'll be fine

You'll get yours

When I get mine



Got a letter

From the IRS

Saying your tax return

Is a terrible mess

We want our money

We don't like to wait

Please come in and see us

On such and such a date

Right now

Right away

Don't get crazy

Don't try no mess

Or we'll take all your money

Soon as you get paid

Soon as you get paidWhen I was a young boy

Well they tried to tell me

That I was movin'

Movin' way too fast

And I knew everything

About everything

But I really didn't wanna listen

To a bunch of old folks talkin' trash



So I got out on the highway

Pedal to the floor

Smokin' and drinkin'

And a whole lot more

But when they came to collect me

Out of that jail

They said boy next time

You get no bail



(Chorus:)

You better slow down

You better slow down



Woke up one mornin'

Ooh to a hunger

I moaned

And I began to twitch

Felt the need

For some lovin'

A little sweet somebody

To scratch my itch

Momma said I don't mean to pry

But I'm here to advise you

Seeds like to grow

When you put 'em in fertilizer



(Chorus)



Doin' my own thing

I'm all grown up

Yes I am

Little bit older

But I feel like a young buck

I'm ridin' down the highway

In a brand new mini van

Wife and kids screamin'

Ooh God I'm a family man

I'm outta mind

Losin control

I could leave tomorrow

But there ain't nowhere to go



(Chorus)Takin' it easy, moving slow

It's always calm just before the storm, you know

Along she came, with a brand new season

Since we've been together

There's been a change in the weather



(Chorus:)

She's a rainmaker

She makes the rain fall from my eyes

She's a rainmaker

She makes a grown man wanna cry



Well, I never thought

That a tear could fall

From the eyes of a man

Who never even cried at all

Now, I've been happy

I've been blue

For the change in the season



(Chorus)



The lightning flashes, the thunder roars

There's no stoppin' the wind

The tide is washing

Her a path to my door

I've never ever loved like this before



Storm is over, the sun is bright

There's a rainbow in my life

Clouds are gone, the sky is clear

And since we've been together

There's been a change in the weather



(Chorus 2x)You had style, you had class

You had everything to make a love last

You had grace, you had charm

You had me hanging on your arm

When I found out you were a fake

You rared up and bit me like a snake

And I was ready to let go

And let all my feelings show



(Chorus:)

Tell me why you wanna be so cold

Why you wanna be so mean

You've gone and let your true colors show

You're a perpetual blues machine



We could have been just fine

If you'd have only been all mine

'Cause I was for real, but you did not know

That you were steppin' on my heart

As you were walkin' out the door

But now I know who you are

And it's a damn good thing we didn't get too far

'Cause I'm not the one that's right for you



You need a man to do your rolling

Like what you want him to do



(Chorus)



Now you've gone, and I'm glad

That we didn't let it go too bad

You know I tried to make it go

But there was just no way to tell u so



(Chorus)If I never get to heaven I don't care

I been down to the crossroads

And there ain't no devil down there

They got the whole town shakin'

Out in L.A.

They got the blues in Mississippi

I'm going back some day



And I ain't gonna fuss and fight

I ain't stayin' up all night

Worryin' 'bout the things that I can't change

Let everybody think I'm a little bit strange



(Chorus:)

Cause I love Muddy Water

It's dirty but it feels alright

I love Muddy Waters

I'm ready for the blues tonight-ooh yes I am



On my way to California

My old car broke down

I left it sittin' right there

And I walked on into town

I found a cheap hotel

Got a twenty dollar room

And when I woke up the next day

It was four o'clock in the afternoon



Well I ain't gonna fuss and fight

I ain't stayin' up all night

Worryin' 'bout the things that I can't change

Let everybody think I'm a little bit strange



(Chorus)



Ooh why should I worry all night and day

Whatever it is

It's gonna be ok



(Chorus)Daddy came around every once in awhile

But momma, she was there all the time

And summertime in Compton

Was not like TV

But we were right there

Where we needed to be

And the Thurmond boys

On peach street

With only their dad

So proud of themselves

And that old Pontiac they had

And miss brooks her bible

And her three little boys

At the double rock

Baptist church

Makin' a joyful noise



(Chorus:)

Well there's more than

One way home

Ain't no right way

Ain't no wrong

And whatever road you

Might be on

You find your own way

'Cause there's more than

One way home



Got me a job at the grocery store

Workin' weekdays after

School from 5 to 9

Tommy, John and Charlie were

The neighborhood stars



With their midsize homes,

And their big fancy cars

And when the eagle flied on Friday

I'd go out and play

Wastin' time with Otis

Out on the dock of the bay

And my ticket to adventure

Was a ride on the bus

Different places,

Different faces

But they were just like us



(Chorus 2x)Lullaby baby blues

Time to kick off your walkin' shoes

And hug the pillow on your bed

And lay down your sleepy head



Hush now no need to talk

Hear the ticking of the clock

Stars that twinkle, stars that shine

Dream and you'll have wings



Goodnight baby blues

Close your eyes baby blues

The moonlit sky watches over you

So close your eyes baby blues



Lullaby baby blues

Time to kick off your walkin' shoes

And hug the pillow on your bed

And lay down your sleepy head



Goodnight baby blues

Close your eyes baby blues

The moonlit sky watches over you

Close your eyes baby bluesI love the way you love me and I love the way you comb your
hair

I love the way you love me, baby, love the way you comb your hair

If it would left up to me, babe, you would never 

...




Hey, sweet mama, baby, don't you go too far

Hey, sweet mama, baby, don't you go too far

I wanna know every minute who you're with and where you are



I love you, baby, so please don't you leave me here all alone

I can't stand it, baby, when you leave me here all alone

So whenever you decide to go, baby, just don't stay gone too long



I love you, baby, I just can't leave you alone

You know, I love you, baby, and I just can't leave you alone

I love you baby just like a dog loves a bone



I'm gonna wrap my arms around you and squeeze you till I cry

I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, squeeze you till I cry (yes, I
am)

Gonna keep on loving you, baby, till the day I die



(It's gonna be a long time)

Hello my old friend

It's been awhile

All our old clothes

Are back in style

We went our separate ways,

Only to return

To face a lesson

We failed to learn



We didn't understand the truth

We were blinded by the eyes of youth

But time kept on moving

And a change has come

You think that I don't know

Where you're coming from



(Chorus:)

'Cause I feel just like you

And I cry just like you

But I heal just like you

And under my skin

I'm just like you



You gave your love and your innocence

And they took away your confidence

Well I'm not those women

I'm not those men

Put your arms around me

I am your friend





(Chorus)



(Bridge:)

You and everybody else

When I get hurt

I cry for help

And I've got secrets

That god only knows

And god knows I feel...



(Chorus)Wait a minute baby

Don't leave just yet

I can explain baby

But it looks like the more I talk

The madder you get

It's not what you think it is

Trust me, I wouldn't do you no harm

She means nothing to me

The whole time I was imagining

It was you in my arms

You in my arms



(Chorus:)

I was wrong

And I admit it

My explanations

Don't seem to get it

I was wrong

And my heart can't take it

If you leave me now

I'm not gonna make it

I'm not gonna make it-no



What about the good times baby

What about all the fun we had together

It meant a lot to me baby

It must have meant something to you

Well ok, I see your point

But baby please

Don't let a little thing like this come between us

Cause our love is bigger than this

It's more than this

It's bigger than the universe

It's bigger than life



(Chorus x2)So much has went unspoken

Along the way

Hearts have healed

And hearts have broken

In the pain of yesterday

Gone are the shadows

They vanished in the Light

Let your heart surrender

Let your soul take flight



(Chorus:)

And let bygones be bygones

And troubles be long gone

And if I never told you

How I feel about you

I'm telling you now



We gather here together

With all of our friends

In a room full of love and laughter

The healing begins

And if this was my last moment

My last breath

I'd wanna be surrounded

With joy and happiness



(Chorus)



And if I never told you

How I feel about you

I'm telling you nowGet with me baby

I'm on your side

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Well there's a change

In the weather

Change of time

But I'm a stubborn man

I won't change my mind

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Talk to me baby

I'm on your side

Talk with me baby

I'm on your side



I don't wanna argue

Sure don't wanna fight

Just tell me what's wrong

And let me make it alright

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Ill be your sugar daddy

Just call on me

Ill be your vigilante

If that's what you need baby

What I need to be girl



Get with me baby

I'm on your side

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Now I don't wanna own you

Like a private property

Come on baby

Just be nice to me

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Get with me baby

I'm on your sideYou tell me that you love me

That you really care

We've talked it out

We did our best

And still it ain't going nowhere



It feels like our forever

just ended yesterday

And all our tomorrow's

Were simply tossed away



Should I stay, should I go, I don't know



Could it be I've always

Known it all along

And didn't have the courage

To tell you what was wrong



What's the in cryin

Why should we be sad

Maybe in the long run

It really ain't so sad



Should I stay, should I go, I don't know



Whatever I tell myself

Whatever I do

I can't get a hold on nothing

And I can't break through

Whenever I feel myself

Slipping away

I'm gonna hold on



There's a time to walk away

And a time to learn

A time will come when Ill know

Just when and where to turn



Until we know the answer

Faith is all we have

Our trust is in the moment

Fear is in the pastRemember if you can

When cotton was picked by hand

Down in Dixie

Under southern skies

Working from sun to sun

Remember if you will

Lightnin' from a whiskey still

Blues in the breeze

The sweet magnolia trees

A little church house up on the hill



(Chorus:)

I can hear the delta calling

From the light of a distant star

I can see my future

And I can feel my past

When Henry plays his steel guitar



Won't you take me back in time

Free me from this crime

Well I have no shame

And I have no blame

It's time for us to be moving on



I can hear the delta calling

From the light of a distant star

I can see my future

And I can feel my past

When Henry plays his steel guitar



(Chorus x2)



I can hear the delta calling

From the light of a distant star

I can see my future

And I can feel my past

When Henry plays his steel guitarIf your problems

Won't go away

And you're worried

Both night and day

Hand it over

Get on your knees and pray



If you're sick

Feeling low

Got no money

Got nowhere to go

Hand it over

Get on your knees and pray



(Chorus:)

Hand it over

Hand it over

Give it up, give it over

Hand it over

Get on your knees and pray



(Bridge:)

Ain't no mountain

You cant climb

Ain't no answer

You can't find

All you need is a hand to hold

Ill heal your body

And feed your soul



If the road is dark

And you can`t find your way

Just let the spirit light the way

Hand it over

Get on your knees and pray



(Chorus)



(Bridge)



(Chorus)Well you might be saved

You might be reborn

You might own a car

With a big loud horn



Maybe it's just news

On your television

Or it might be God trying to get your attention



Are you an engineer

Working on a farm

Or a Casanova

With a whole lotta charme



It might be a mouse

Living in your kitchen

Or it might be God trying to get your attention



Well it might sound bad

Or it might sound good

Might be made of steel

Or it might be made of wood



Maybe it's just news

On your television

Or it might be God trying to get your attention



Well it might be in the church house

Or it might be on the street

Somehow or another

Every soul has got to meet



Well it might be in the city

Or it might be in town

One way or another

You're gonna find a higher ground



Well you might be deaf

Or you might be blind

She'll put the message

Right in your mind



Might look like a plan

Or a coalition

Or it might be God trying to get your attention



Well you might be deaf

Or you might be dumb

You'll get the answer

When the answer comes



Maybe it's just news on your television

Or it might be God trying to get your attention

It might be God trying to get your attentionAin't got no money

No where to sleep

No friend no family

No bread no meat

No bread no meat

No friend no family

No bread, no bread no meat



I ain't got no reason

Ain't got no rhyme

Ain't gettin' no younger

And I'm runnin' outta time

Runnin' outta time

Ain't gettin' no younger

And I'm runnin' outta time

Oh yes I am



(Chorus:)

But I'm still climbing up the mountain side

Don't count me out

Long as I got my heart and soul

I got everything

I got everything I need

Everything I need



Ain't got no window

Ain't got no door

But I can feel the sun shining

Where it's never shined before

Never shined before

Feel the sun shining where it's never shined before



(Chorus 2x)



But I'm still climbing up the mountain side

Can't count me out

Long as I got my heart and soul

I got everything

I got everything I need

Everything I need



Ain't got no picture

Ain't got no wall

Ain't got nobody

Hear me when I call

Hear me when I call

Ain't got nobody

Hear me when I call



(Chorus)Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

I done called up the bossman

Told him where to go

And just what to do



Call me crazy

But i did what I had to do

You can call me stupid

I just did what I had to do

I had to steal a little time baby

So I could spend it all on you

I parked the car down the street

And I unplugged the phone

So it would look just like

Ain't nobody home

I put a rose on your pillow

Where you lay your pretty head

I'm gonna rub your tired shoulders

Bring your dinner to your bed



Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

I had to steal a little time baby

So I could spend it all on you



I'm gonna light a candle

Put the champagne on ice

And if one ain't enough

Well we'll just have to do it twice

I done made myself a will

And I've called my next of kin

'Cause I'm gonna love you over

And over and over

Again and again



Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

I had to steal a little time baby

So I could spend it all on you



Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

I just this one last paycheck baby

And I'm gonna spend every dime on youFor the lyrics see Robert Johnson's original song, 
take1

and take2None of my business, getting all of my concern

Tried to put out the fire, but the flame still burns

And as she pleases she comes and goes

She's got the wind in her hair

She never ceases to hurt me so



Does she really care?

Is she ever coming home?

Is she ever gonna phone?

Another night alone



Has anybody seen my girl?

Has anybody seen my woman?

California, Tennessee

Send my baby home to me



Where am I going, oh what am I gonna do?

I know I'm not crazy, I'm just hooked on you

So go on and use me endlessly

Could you let me know

When you need me hold me close

And baby don't let go

Are you ever coming home?

Are you ever gonna phone?

Another night alone

Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone



Well, now my bed is empty, my feets and my hands are cold

You know my bed is empty, my feets and my hands are cold

Come on home, Angelina, my love for you will never grow old



Well now I've tried to love you with diamonds and pearls

But all that did was tear us apart

And I've tried to give you everything in the world

When all you really wanted - to wound my heart, oh-ho

Down the road and back again

To prove I'm a man

I don't need no trophy

To prove I'm a man

To make you stay

I ain't going nowhere

What am I gonna do now

Am I gonna make it

Someway, somehow

Maybe I'm supposed to cry

And if nobody ever knows

The way I feel

It's all right

And it'll be ok



(Chorus:)

I'm gonna make my world a better place

I'm gonna keep that smile on my face

I'm gonna teach myself how to understand

I'm gonna make myself a better man



Climbing out of the window

Climbing up the wall

Is anybody gonna save me

Or are they gonna let me fall

Well I don't really wanna know

I#180;ll just hold on the best I can

And if I fall down

I#180;ll just get back up

It'll be alright

It'll be ok



(Chorus 2x)



Maybe I'm not supposed to know

Maybe I'm supposed to cry

And if nobody ever knows

The way I feel

That's all right

It'll be ok
