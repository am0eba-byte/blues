alone

Well she grabbed my baby, spanked him and tried to make her leave him

Now if you don't love me, please don't dog me around

If you don't love me, please don't dog me around, Shuckin' Sugar

People, since its raining, it has been for nights and days

People, since its raining, has been for nights and days

Thousands people stands on the hill, looking down were they used to

stay




Children stand there screaming: mama, we ain't got no home

Oh, mama we ain't got no home

Papa says to the children, "Backwater left us all alone"



Backwater rising, come in my windows and door

The backwater rising, come in my windows and door

I leave with a prayer in my heart, backwater won't rise no more



Getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell



Lay awake at night and just can't eat a bite

Used to be my 
rider
but she just won't treat me right



Got a red-eyed captain and a squabbling boss

Got a mad dog sergeant, honey, and he won't knock off



I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

Lord, I wouldn't 've been here if it had not been for Nell



I asked the government to knock some days off my time

Well, the way I'm treated, I'm about to lose my mind



I wrote to the governor, please turn me a-loose

Since I don't get no answer, I know it ain't no use



I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell



I hate to turn over and find my rider gone

Walking across my floor, Lordy, how I moan



Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell

I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell



I'm achin' all over, baby, b'lieve I got the pneumonia this time

An' it's all on account of that low-down gal of mine



Slippin' round the corners, running up alleys too

Slippin' round the corners, running up alleys too

Watching my woman trying to see what she goin' do



Sat out in the streets one cold, dark, stormy night

Sat out in the streets one cold, dark, stormy night

Trying to see if my good gal going to make it home all right



Wearin' B.V.D.'s

in the winter, prowling 'round in the rain

Wearin' B.V.D.'s in the winter, prowling 'round in the rain

Runnin' down baby, give me this pneumonia pain

My baby's voice sounds so sweet, almost wrecked the telephone



You don't know your love, you're wrapped deep so far from you

You don't know your love, your letter, I said she's so far from
you

You can get a long distance moan, and you don't care what you do

I want to shake hands with my partner, ask him how come he's here

I had a wreck with my family, they're gonna send me to the electric

chair




I wonder why they electrocute a man at the one o'clock hour of
night

And I wonder why they electrocute a man at the one o'clock hour of
night

Because the current is much stronger, when the folks has turned out

all the lights




I sat in the electrocutin' room, my arms folded up and cryin'

I sat in the electrocutin' room, my arms folded up and cryin'

And my baby asked the question, was they gonna electrocute that man

of mine?




Lemon, get me a taxi to take me away from here

Lemon, get me a taxi to take me all away from here

I haven't had a good friend in this world, since they lead Lemon to

the electric chair




I feel like jumpin' in the ocean, I feel like jumpin' in the deep
blue sea

I feel like jumpin' in the ocean, and like jumpin' into the deep blue
sea

But nothin' like that wrecked in my heart when they brought my

electrocuted daddy to me

I've done met a mama, she ain't long in or tall

I say I got another mama, she ain't long in or tall

But to tell you the truth, man, she's as soft as a butter ball
