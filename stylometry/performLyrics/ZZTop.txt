Long as she got the keys and there's a spare wheel in her trunkI've gotten good at missin' her, I practice all the time

While I drive the Pan Am highway thru, with that cactus friend of
mine

It's gettin' hard to see the white line rollin' by, I can't forget

her memory deep inside




I dropped a bundle down in Panama, but the loss didn't do me no
good

Spendin' cash and talkin' trash, don't do it like it should

I realized I just couldn't buy her smile, I'll keep tryin' on that

Pan Am mile by mile




If she'd meet me in San Salvador, I'd buy her a drink or two

We'd talk about our used to be, and ride on to Peru

The time to get it right is here and now, if she won't I'll move onanyhowNeighbor, neighbor, why you messin' in my life?

Neighbor, neighbor, you've been talkin' to my wife

Tellin' her you seen me, runnin' wild the other night, runnin' wild
the other night



A neighbor, neighbor, there's always one in every crowd

A neighbor, neighbor, tellin' lies and talkin' loud

You better watch your step now, you might fall off your cloud, you
might fall off your cloud



Now I was walking down a dusty road when along came a neighbor of
mine

He saw me walkin' with my head hung down, he just had to stop and
pass the time
