Lord, walkin' 'round the bedside, these was the last words my baby
had to say

She said, "Bring me some flowers, be sure, honey on ev'ry decorationday"I'm got to change my way of livin', this life I'm livin' ain't
no good

I'm got to change my way of livin', this life I'm livin' ain't no
good

I leave home in the morning, don't come back 'til the break of

dawn




My baby said that ain't right, I'll admit that is true

My baby said that ain't right, I'll admit that is true

She said daddy, daddy, you got to change the way you do



You know I leave in the mornin', and I don't come back 'til dawn

You know I leaves in the mornin', and I don't come back 'til dawn

My baby looked me in the eyes, and said daddy, you got to change yourevil wayBe careful what you're drivin', man

That Cadillac may get away, you better be careful!



There standin' the highway man, standin' parked on the road

There standin' there highway man, parked on the road

You better watch out for the red light, just before you go



Green light says go, red light says stop

Look-a-here boy, you better be on your watch

There's standin' a highway man, parked on the side of the road

You better be careful, 'bout how you drive on the road

Stop!



I love the Cadillac, long wreckin' machine

I love a Cadillac, it's a long wreckin' machine

Me an my baby can ride it, ev'rything is nice 'til then

(Yeah!)



I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas

I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas

I'm gonna drive this automobile, just as long as the gas lasts

(Play it!)



Look-it-here man, please check this oil

Look-it here man, please check this oil

Just a long Cadillac, bound to try out your soil



Some folk built like this, some folk built like that

But the way I'm built, you shouldn't call me fat

Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

But I got everything all the good girls need



I don't have no diamond, and I don't have no gold

But I've got a lot of lovin' and I want you to know

That I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

But I got everything all the good girls need

But if you want me, you got to take your time

Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

But I got everything all of the good girls need
