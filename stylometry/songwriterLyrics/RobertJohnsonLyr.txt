On that Gulfport Island



I got a kindhearted mama, do anything in this world for me

I got a kindhearted mama, do anything in this world for me

But these evil-hearted women, man, they will not let me be



I love my baby, my baby don't love me

I love my baby, ooooh, my baby don't love me

Now there ain't but the one thing, makes Mister Johnson
drink

about how you treat me, baby, I begin to think

Oh babe, my life don't feel the same

You breaks my heart, when you call Mister So-and-So's name



She's a kindhearted mama, she studies evil all the time

She's a kindhearted woman, but she studies evil all the time

You well's

Some day, some day, I would shake your hand goodbye

I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

I'm a poor drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

And if I could only change my way of livin', it would mean so much to

me




I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

And I can't see the reason why, that I can't leave these no-good

women's alone




My poor father died and left me, and my mother done the best that she
could

My poor father died and left me, and my mother done the best that she
could

Every man love that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no

good




I'm the poor drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

I'm a poor drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

But the day you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that yousurely fallI'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

And if I could change my way of livin', it would mean so much to

me




I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

And I can't see the reason why that, I can't leave these no-good

women's alone




My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she
could

My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she
could

Every man likes that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no

good




Now, I'm the drunken hearted man and sin was the cause of it all

(spoken: Oh, play 'em now)

I'm a drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

And the day that you get weak for no-good women, that's the day thatyou bound to fallI woke up this mornin' and all my shrimps was dead and gone

I woke up this mornin', ooh, and all my shrimp was dead and gone

I was thinkin' about you, baby, why you hear me weep and moan


I got dead shrimps here, someone is fishin' in my pond

I got dead shrimps here, ooh, someone fishin' in my pond

I've served my best bait, baby, and I can't do that no harm

Everything I do, babe, you got your mouth stuck out

Hole where I used to fish, you got me posted out

Everything I do, you got your mouth stuck out,

at the hole where I used to fish, baby, you've got me posted out


I got dead shrimps here, 'n' someone fishin' in my pond

I got dead shrimps here, someone fishin' in my pond

Catchin' my goggle-eye perches, and they barbequin' the bone


Now you taken my shrimps, baby, you know you turned me down

I couldn't do nothin', until I got myself unwound

You taken my shrimps, oohh, know you turned me down

Babe, I couldn't do nothin', until I got myself unwound

I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees

I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees

Asked the Lord above "Have mercy, save poor Bob, if you please"



Mmmmm, standin' at the crossroad, I tried 
to
flag a ride

Standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride

Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by



Mmmm, the sun goin' down, boy, dark gon' catch me here

Oooo, oooeeee, boy, dark gon' catch me here

I haven't got no lovin' sweet woman that love and feel my care

Asked the Lord above "Have mercy, now save poor Bob, if you

please"




Yeoo, standin' at the crossroad, tried 
to

Didn't nobody seem to know me, babe, everybody pass me by



Standin' at the crossroad, baby, risin' sun goin' down

You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down

Lookin' for yo' good friend, none can be found

You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


Nnn, the woman I love, took from my best friend

Some joker got lucky, stole her back again

She better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

(spoken: Mama, can't you hear that wind howl?

Oh how the wind do howl!)

You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


Nnn, the woman that I love, I crave to see

She's up the country, won't write to me

Then, you better come on in my kitchen, goin' to be rainin' outdoors


I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see

Some other man got my woman, lonesome blues got me

But she better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


My mamma dead, papa well's

to be, ain't got nobody to love and care for me

She better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

Ah, the woman I love, took from my best friend, some joker got lucky, stole her back again
You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors






Ohah, she's gone, I know she won't come back

I've taken the last nickel out of her
nation sack
You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
(spoken: oh, can't you hear that wind howl?)
Oh y', can't you hear that wind would howl?
You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down










Lookin' for her good friend, none can be found

You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
Winter time's comin', it's gon' be slow
You can't make the winter, babe, that's
dry long so
You better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
