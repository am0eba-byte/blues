Woke up this mornin' when chickens was crowin' for day

Felt on the right side of my pilla', my man gad gone away

By this pilla' he left a note readin', "I'm sorry, Jane, you got my
goat

No time to marry, no time to settle down"



I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round

I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round

Some people call me a 

hobo
,
some call me a bum




Nobody knows my name, nobody knows what I've done

I'm as good as any woman in your town

I ain't no 

high
yeller
, I'm a deep killer of brown


I ain't gonna marry, ain't gonna settle down



I'm gonna drink good 
moonshine

and rub these browns down

See that long lonesome road

Lawd, you know it's gotta and I'm a good woman and I can get plentymenI've lived a life but nothin' I've gained

Each day I'm full of sorrow and pain

No one seems to care enough for poor me,

to give me a word of sympathy

Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



No father to guide me, no mother to care

Must bear my troubles alone

Not even a brother to help me share

This burden I must bear alone

Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



I'm settin' and thinkin' of the days gone by

They filled my heart with pain

I'm too weak to stand and too strong to cry

But I'm forgittin' it all in vain

Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



I've traveled and wandered almost everywhere

To git a little joy from life

Still I've gained nothin' but wars and despairs

Still strugglin' in this world of strife

Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?Did you ever sit thinking with a thousand things on your
mind?

Did you ever sit thinking with a thousand things on your mind?

Thinking about someone who has treated you so nice and kind



You'll get an old letter and you begin to read

You'll get an old letter and you begin to read

Got the blues so bad tell that man of mine I wanna be



Don't you hear me baby, knocking on your door?

Don't you hear me baby, knocking on your door?

Have you got the nerve to drive me from your door?



Have you got the nerve to say that you don't want me no more?

Have you got the nerve to say that you don't want me no more?

The good book said you got to reap what you sow



Take me back baby, try me one more time

Take me back baby, try me one more time

That's the only way I can get these thinking blues off my mindStandin' in the rain and ain't a drop fell on me

Standin' in the rain and ain't a drop fell on me

My clothes is all wet but my flesh is as dry as can be



It can rain all day, I ain't got no place to go

It can rain all day, I ain't got no place to go

Because it's cold outside in that ice and snow



If it rains five days that won't give me no blues

If it rains five days that won't give me no blues

I've got my raincoat and hat, umbrella, boots and shoes



Rain, rain, rain don't rain on me all day

Rain, rain, rain don't rain on me all day

'Cause if I get too wet I've got to go into the house and stayIf you catch me stealin', I don't mean no harm

If you catch me stealin', I don't mean no harm

It's a mark in my family and it must be carryin' on



I got nineteen men and won't want more

I got nineteen men and won't want more

If I had one more I'd let that nineteen go



It's hard to love another woman's man

It's hard to love another woman's man

You catch him when you want him, you got to catch him when you
can



Have you ever seen a peaches grow on sweet potato vine?

Have you ever seen a peaches grow on sweet potato vine ?

Just step in my backyard and take a peep at mine



I'm gonna tell you, daddy, like Solomon
1
 told the Jew
I'm gonna tell you, daddy, like Solomon told the Jew

If you don't like-ee me, I sure don't like-ee you



Captain, tell your men to get on board

Hoist your sail, just pull into another shore



I'm dreary in mind and I'm so worried in heart

Oh the best of friends sho' has got to part



Blow your whistle captain, so your men'll know what to do

Blow your whistle captain, so your men'll know what to do

When a woman gets dreary ain't no tellin' what she won't do



It's cloudy outdoors as can be

Oh it's cloudy as can be

That's the time I need my good man with me



It's rainin' and it's stormin' on the sea

It's rainin', it's stormin' on the sea

I feel like somebody has shipwrecked poor meLet me tell you how and why what no-good man done to me

He called me pretty, young and wild, after that he let me be

He'd taken advantage of my mouth, and that you understand

So, wait a while, show you, chile, just how to treat a no-good

man




Make him stay at home, wash and iron,

tell all the neighbors he done lost his mind

Give your house rent shake
1
 on Saturday night
Monday morning you'll hold collectors good and tight

You see a man you really like

Let him bite that monkey, brother, in his back

When his cruel heart turn, his love breaks down

hold him where you got him make him stay in town,

'cause I'm a safety woman, lookin' for a safety man



Make him stay at home, help me wash and iron,

the neighbors know he done lost his mind

I give a house rent shake on Saturday night

Monday morning I held collectors good and tight

I seen a man I really like

I let him bite that monkey, brother, smack in his back

When his cruel heart turn, his love breaks down

I hold it where I had it and he stayed in town,

I'm a safety woman, and I had to have a safety man



I ain't good lookin', I'm built for speed

I've got ev'rything a pigmeat needs

'Cause I'm a safety woman, lookin' for a safety man



When I wasn't nothin' but a child

When I wasn't nothin' but a child

All you men tried to drive me wild



Now I'm growin' old

Now I'm growin' old

and I've got what it takes to get all of you men told



My mama says I'm reckless, my daddy says I'm wild

My mama says I'm reckless, my daddy says I'm wild

I ain't good lookin' but I'm somebody's angel child



Daddy, mama wants some lovin'

Daddy, mama wants some huggin'

Darn it pretty papa, mama wants some lovin' I vow

Darn pretty papa, mama wants some lovin' right nowDown in Atlanta, GA, under the viaduct ev'ry day, drinking corn and hollerin' hooray

Pianos playing till the break of day

But as I turned my head, I loudly said, "Preach 'em blues, sing them
blues"

They certainly sound good to me

I've been in love for the last six months and ain't done worrying
yet

Moan'em blues, holler them blues

Let me convert your soul

'Cause just a little spirit of the blues tonight

Let me tell you, girls, that your man ain't treating you right

Let me tell you I don't mean no wrong

I will learn you something if you listen to this song

I ain't here to try to save your soul, just want to teach you how to

save your good jelly roll




Going on down the line a little further now

There's many a poor woman down

Read on down to chapter nine,

woman must learn how to take their time

Read on down to chapter ten,

taking other women's men, you are doing a sin

Sing'em, sing'em, sing them blues

Let me convert your soul

Now one sister by the name of Sister Green

jumped up and done a shimmy you ain't never seen

Sing'em, sing'em, sing them blues

Let me convert your soulGirls, I wanna tell you about these sweet men

These men goin' around here tryin' to play cute

I'm hard on you boys, yes sir!



I fell in love with a sweet man once

He said he loved me too

He said if I'd run away with him

What nice things he would do

I'd travel around from town to town

How happy I would feel

But don't you know he would not work

Girls, take this tip from me



Get a working man when you marry

And let all these sweet men be

Child, it takes money to run a business

And with me I know you girls will agree

There's one thing about this married life

That these young girls have got to know

Say, if a sweet man enter your front gate

Turn out your light and lock your door



Yes, get a working man when you marry

Let all these pinchbacks
1
be 
Child, it takes money to run a business

And with me I know you girls will agree

And if this panic stays on much longer

I'll hear all these young girls say

That it's a long way to Oklahoma

But these little pinchbacks, take them away



My best man, my best friend,

told me to stop peddlin'
1
gin 
They even told me to keep my hands

out people's pocket where their money was in



But I wouldn't listen or have any shame,

'long as someone else would take the blame

Now I can see it all come home to me

I'm sittin' in the jailhouse now

I mean, I'm in the jailhouse now



I done stop runnin' around with this one

and these good lookin' browns

Any time you see me, I was good time bound,

with this one, that one, most all in town

I'm in the jailhouse now,

I'm sittin' in the jailhouse now

When you get a good gal, you'd better treat her nice



When you were lonesome, I treated you kind
