I could see, everybody's baby, but I couldn't see mine

I could see, the ships pullin' in, to the harbor

I could see the people, meetin' their loved one

Shakin' hand, I sat there,

so all alone, coverin' the waterfront



And after a while, all the people,

left the harbor, and headed for their destination

All the ships, left the harbor,

and headed for their next destination

I sat there, coverin' the waterfront



And after a while, I looked down the ocean,

as far as I could see, in the fog, I saw a ship

It headed, this way, comin' out the foam

It must be my baby, comin' down

And after a while, the ship pulled into the harbor,

rollin' slow, so cripple

And my baby, stepped off board

I was still, coverin' the waterfront



Said "Johnny, our ship had trouble, with the fog

And that's why we're so late, so late

Comin' home, comin' down'

Wanna tell you a story,

about the house-man blues

I come home one Friday,

had to tell the landlady I'd-a lost my job

She said that don't confront me,

long as I get my money next Friday

Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent,

and out the door I went



So I goes to the landlady,

I said, "You let me slide?"

I'll have the rent for you in a month.

next I don't know

So said let me slide it on you know people,

I notice when I come home in the evening

She ain't got nothing nice to say to me,

but for five year she was so nice

Loh' she was lovy-dovy,

I come home one particular evening

The landlady said, "You got the rent money yet?",

I said, "No, can't find no job"

Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent

She said "I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job"

Said "I seen you today you was standin' on a corner,

leaning up against a post"

I said "But I'm tired, I've been walkin' all day"

She said "That don't confront me,

long as I get my money next Friday"

Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent,

and out the door I went



So I go down the streets,

down to my good friend's house

I said "Look man I'm outdoors you know,

can I stay with you maybe a couple days?"

He said "Let me go and ask my wife"

He come out of the house,

I could see it in his face

I know that was no

He said "I don't know man, ah she kinda funny, you know"

I said "I know, everybody funny, now you funny too"

So I go back home

I tell the landlady I got a job, I'm gonna pay the rent

She said "Yeah?" I said "Oh yeah"

And then she was so nice,

loh' she was lovy-dovy

So I go in my room, pack up my things and I go,

I slip on out the back door and down the streets I go

She a-howlin' about the front rent, she'll be lucky to get any back
rent,

she ain't gonna get none of it
